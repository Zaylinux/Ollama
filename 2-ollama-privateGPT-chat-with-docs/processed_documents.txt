6 Parts to the Adon’s Prayer 
 
1- Direct Your Prayers to our Father in Heaven 
2- It’s all about His Kingdom & His Will 
3- A Request for Our Needs 
4- Ask For Forgiveness As You Forgive Others 
5- Ask Him To Keep You From Temptation & Deliver You From Satan 
6- Remember His Power and Glory and Kingdom is Forever 
 
#1 -  Direct Your Prayers to Our Father in Heaven 
He starts off with “Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name”. 
When you pray make sure you speak to the Father directly. 
 
#2 -  It’s all about His Kingdom & His Will 
Yahshua says “Your kingdom come. Your will be done” We often want to pray to Him about our requests and what 
we need Him to do for us.  What we don’t understand at times is that a lot of our prayers do not get answered 
because what we want is often about ourselves and not about His will & His Kingdom.  We are His servants preparing 
His Kingdom. After you acknowledge and call out to Him, make sur

==================================================

=== CHUNK 2 ===
e you put His will and His Kingdom first.  Yahshua 
is showing submission. We are about preparing His Kingdom and we submit to His will. 
 
#3 -  A Request for Our Needs 
Yahshua says “Give us this day our daily bread”. If you go back to Israel’s exodus from Egypt.  He provided their 
daily bread when He provided their daily supply of manna.  He knew their needs and He provided for them.  So 
whether it is food, money, shelter, etc., ask Him to take care of it.  Now warning: do not be upset if you prayed for 
something and you did not receive it.  Remember right before you asked, you told Him it’s about His will. Make sure 
you meant it. 
 
#4 -  Ask For Forgiveness, As You Forgive Others 
He says, “And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors”. Something we need to always incorporate in our 
walk is forgiveness.  We want forgiveness, but we also must do it as well.  He said after the prayer “For if you 
forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. B

==================================================

=== CHUNK 3 ===
ut if you do not forgive men their 
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses”. So make sure you are not walking with 
unforgiveness in your heart. 
 
#5 -  Ask Him To Keep You From Temptation & Deliver You From Satan  
He says, “And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one” So many of us struggle with so many different 
temptations, but ask yourself: Are you asking the Father for help with this? He will help you if you are asking Him.  
This is why Yahshua told you to include this in your prayer.  
 
#6 -  Remember His Power and Kingdom is Forever 
He says, “For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever“.  It’s all His, and He has all the Power & 
Glory Forever.  Remember that and acknowledge it when speaking with Him.

He says of his book. "My motive
in writing
it was to give the
true history of the Afro-American, which has been excluded from
textbooks". Professor Windsor is a strong advocator of the economic
and
cultural development of the black community.
In
serving
the
community,
he
has

1970's.
Moreover. Mr. Windsor
is the author of the book: The Valley of
the Dry Bones; subtitled. The Conditions That Face Black People in
America. 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 7 ===
As a result of some difficulties with several book companies,
Mr. Windsor established his own company called Windsor's Golden
Series Publications. In
1988. Mr. Windsor redesigned his
first book;
From Babylon To Timbuktu.
Again. Mr. Windsor over the years, has appeared on radio and

will impart
truth,
self-

More than
six
thousand
years ago
in
the
land
called
Mesopotamia there developed the most remarkable
civiliza-
tion then known to mankind. This civilization was centered
between
the Tigris and
the Euphrates
rivers. These
rivers
begin
in
the mountains
of Armenia and
flow
in
a
south

==================================================

=== CHUNK 15 ===
-
eastern direction toward the Persian Gulf. The
soil of
this
area
is tremendously fertile because of the alluvial deposits
brought down by the two rivers. European
civilization de-
veloped from ancient black civilization. Without
this black
civilization, white domination and influence as we know
it
today would have been improbable.
A number
of
different
tribes were
entrenched
in
the
southern part of the Tigris-Euphrates region. This southern
section was known at different times by many names, amon<*
Which are Sumer, Akkad
(or Accad) and Chaldea;
but
the
name
best known
to us
is
Babylonia. This area was
also
the location of the Garden of Eden, and the people of
this
region were jet black. 1
I
shall
prove
conclusively
that
the
black
people
have
the most ancient history of all humans. The best available
source
of proof
is the
history of
the Jews, known
as
the
Bible. In Genesis 2:10
it
is written: "And a river went out
of Eden to water the garden: and from thence
it was parted
and became 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 16 ===
into four heads." There were four rivers which
watered the Garden of Eden.
I shall
cite the third and the
fourth
rivers
first; then
I shall proceed
to the
first and
die
11
From Babylon to Timbuktu
second rivers, because
it
fits better into my line of reasoning.
Genesis
2:14
reads: "And
the name
of
the
third
river
is
Hiddekel:
that
is
it which goeth toward the cast of Assyria.
And
the
fourth
river
is
Euphrates."
Commentators
and
scholars have
identified
the river Hiddekcl;
they
say
it
is
the Tigris River. 2 Now
I shall
cite Genesis
2:13. "And
the
name of the second river
is Gihon:
the same
is
it
that com-
passeth
the whole land of
Ethiopia."* Because
the Garden
of Eden
is
associated
with
the
land
of
Ethiopia, we can
conclude
that
the people were
black.
Rashi,
the
eleventh-
century commentator on
the
Bible, said
that
the Gihon
is
the
Nile
River
that bows
through
eastern
Africa.
Rashi,
most likely, makes this point because the Nile flows in Ethi-
opia and into Egypt.
Dr.
Speiscr, who was


==================================================

=== CHUNK 17 ===
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania, said: "There
is
.
.
. no basis for the detouring
of the Gihon to Ethiopia [he meant the Ethiopia in Africa],
not
to mention the Pishon in various remote regions of the
world."
I agree with
Dr. Spciser that we should not search
for the Gihon in Africa, nor the Pishon in a remote area of
the earth; but
that we should search for the Pishon and the
Gihon in the Tigris-Euphrates valley. There were two Ethi-
opian nations in ancient times
(eastern Ethiopia and western
Ethiopia). This point Dr.
Speiser
failed
to
elucidate,
pos-
sibly because of an oversight. There was an Ethiopian civili-
zation
in southern Mesopotamia
(Babylon), but the people
in
this region did not
use
their
tribal name,
Ethiopia,
to
designate
their nationality. They called
themselves
by
the
name of the cities that they constructed and
inhabited, or
they
called
themselves
by an
event
that happened
there;
for example, God confused
the
language
of
the
people
at
the Tower of Babel

==================================================

=== CHUNK 18 ===

(Babel means confusion
in Hebrew).
This
is why
the Ethiopian
tribes
called
themselves
Baby-
lonians,
referring
to
the name
of
the
city
that
they
con-
structed.
There are many nations that are not designated by their
true
nationality;
for example,
the white Australians came
Ancient Black Civilization
15
from England, but
those Englishman who
live
in Australia
do not
call
themselves by
their ancestral name.
4 They
call
themselves by the name of the country which they colonized,
which
is Australia.
The people of Australia are represented
in
the United Nations by
the name
of
their nation
(Aus-
tralia) and not under their ancestral name, England.
The people who resided in the lower part of the Tigris-
Euphrates
valley were Ethiopian, black
in complexion. We
read in Genesis
10:8
thai
"(lush begat Nimrod; ..." The
word Cush means Ethiopia, and Cusll was the father of the
Ethiopians. For the meaning of the word Cush, sec Webster's
New Collegiate Dictionary. Nimrod was a mighty Ethiopian

eror and builder
in
the
land of Shinar. 5 We
find
in
Genesis
10:8 10,
(hat
Nimrod
ruled
over
such
cities
as:
liabylon,
Erech,
Accad
(or
Akkad);
all
these
cities
arc
gttuated
in the land of Shinar. Another name
for Shinar
is
Sinner.
This civilization was of a high order, and one of the
oldest
civilizations
in
ancient
times.
In
Genesis
10:7
we
read: "And the sons of Cush; Seba and Havilah, ..." Now
we have learned that Havilah was the son of Cush, who was
an
Ethiopian. The word
Havilah
became
the name
of
a
tribe and a region, known as the Land of Havilah 7 and the
Havilites
(Ethiopians) lived in the Land of Havilah; more-
over, scholars have located
this land near the Persian
Gulf.
In search
of
the Land of Havilah, we
find
that
there was
another Havilah who was one of
the sons of
Joktan
(read
Genesis
10:20-2?)); but
this Havilah was of the line of Shem,
read Genesis
10:22. Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and
Japhcth. The children of Shem are called Shemites. The sons
of Ham
are
called
Ha

==================================================

=== CHUNK 20 ===
ndles, and
the
sons
of Japhcth
are
called Japhites. We should not confuse Havilah, the son of
Joktan, with Havilah, the son of Cush. Now
it
is logical
to
conclude
that
Havilah,
the
son
of
Cush,
is
intended
in
Genesis
2:11
to
be
the Havilah
of the Land
of Havilah;
because that Havilah 8 was
a Cushitc
(Ethiopian),
his habi-
tation would
naturally be adjacent
to
his brother, Nimrod,
who ruled Babylon.
16
From Babylon to Timbuktu
Abraham was one of the fathers of the twelve
tribes of
Israel; and Abraham's father (Terah) came from the land of
Ur of the Chaldees, Genesis 11:26-28. The Land of Ur of the
Chaldees was located at the southern part of the Euphrates.
The Chaldeans were one of many Cushitc tribes. Cush means
black,
according
to
the
Bible
dictionary. This
dictionary
defines
further:
"Cush,
the name
of
a
son
of Ham,
ap-
parently the eldest; and of a territory or territories occupied
by
his descendants. The Cushites appeared
to have spread

tracts

o
the
Eu-
phrates and
the
Tigris
rivers.
History
affords many
con-
nections between
Babylon,
Arabia, and
Ethiopia."9 There
is more than adequate evidence that the ancient nations of
liabylon, Akkadia, Sumer,

From

The
Ark
rested
on
Mt.
Ararat. 2
Mt.
Ararat was located
in the land of Armenia. The words Ar-
menia and Ararat mean high ground.
The entire earth at this time was of one speech and one
language. Most of the people dwelled in the plain of Shinar;
in Hebrew, the Valley of Shinar. Men began
to congregate
in
the
territory and
to build a tower up
to heaven. 3 The
Jewish
historian,
Flavius
Joscphus,
says: "God
also
com-
manded them to send colonies abroad for the thorough peo-
pling of the earth," but the people did not obey God. Now,
when man was
in
the process of building
the
tower, God
disapproved
of
its
construction
because
it
showed
a
dis-
belief
in His word. The Divine had promised Noah
that
He would not destroy

considered
what
had
been done. He confused men's language and scattered them
toward the four directions of the earth.
The sons of Noah were: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 5
Be-
cause the world was popidated from these three sons of Noah,
it
is proper
to
classify men only according
to

parts of the territory of Assyria and Elam

The
third
classification
of
mankind

of Noah. The

The second son of Japheth was Magog, the father of the
Magogites.
Flavius Joscphus
said
that
the
Greeks
called
these
people
Scythians. The
Scythians
included
all
the
wandering
tribes who dwelt mostly near
the north
of
the
Black and Caspian seas. They were regarded by the ancients
as tremendously lacking
in intelligence and civilization.
The third son of Japheth was Madai, the father of
the

From Javan, the fourth son of Japheth, came the lonians

Tubal, the fifth son of Japheth,
is associated with Javan
(Isa. 66:19). Mcshech and Tubal
(Ezek. 32:26 and 39:1) are
nations of the north
(north of the focal point of the land of
Israel). Josephus
identified
the descendants
of Tubal
with
the
early
Iberians
(Iberes). They were
the
inhabitants of

between

north
of Turkey,

and

the Germanic race; in the Hebrew language the word means

By 378 a.d., the Germanic tribes were on the move. They
were known under

The ancient people did

The ancients, including the Greeks and Romans,
identified

At
this
time, Europe
existed
in a
state of darkness for a thousand
years.
In
the
seventeenth century and
later, Europe began
to emerge out
of the slough of ignorance, and certain Germans and others
conceived
of
themselves
as
belonging
to
a
superior
race.
Johann
F. Blumenback, a German
(1752- 1840). was the
first
to divide humanity on
the
basis
of skin
color. Up
to
this
time, no
such
attempts
had
been
made.
His
classification
set up
a color

Mr. Blumenbacb
classified
five chief races of mankind:
the

the
Mongolian,
the

the
American
(American
Indians), and Malayan. Moreover,
lie considered
the
Caucasian
to
be
the
original
race.*
Blumenbacb,
the
anthropologist, named the whites after the Caucasus Moun-
tains
(these mountains are situated between
the Black and
Caspian
seas), because
he thought
the

white people
originated there. 10 Blumenbacb was a racist and so was J. A.

it
led
to
a
horrible, vicious racial philosophy and to the persecution of
the Jews in Nazi Germany.
1 -' T. R. Garth wrote in his book
lince Psychology
(1931), "Any
disposition on
our
part
to
withhold from some race the right to a free and full develop-
ment must be taken
as an
indication of rationalization on

north,
northwest
and
northeast
into
Europe
and
Asiatic Russia. Now, we know that the Japhites (Europeans)
are white today. Were they originally white beginning from
their ancestor, Japhctli, or did
a change materialize
in
the
skin color of the descendants of Japhcth? This question
is
difficult to answer.
I was told that Japhcth was a black man,
but he wanted to be white, so God changed him
to a white
man. Evidence to that theory
is lacking. Nevertheless, scien-
tists and anthropologists have found different kinds of muta-
tions in certain parts of the world. A physical mutation
is a
sudden variation or change, the offspring differing from
its
parents
in some
outstanding
characteristic;
also
a
major
change
in
the chromosomes or genes
that determine hered-
ity. 13 Blond hair among the black Australian aborigines
is
an example of a mutation; 11 and probably albinos are a good
example
of mutations
with
their white

Major mutations or changes
took
place among
the
de-
scendants of Japheth. This
is obvious because of their white
skin. In other words, they were black
at one time but their
skin changed to white. This phenomenon can be understood
in view of

population. Over
two-thirds
of
the population of the world consists of colored people. That
is a ratio of
2-1. Two out of Noah's
three
sons remained
black. We know this to be true because many of the people
throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the
islands
in
the
Pacific Ocean
are yellow, brown
or,
black. They have

the color of the people
in this region ranges from brown

Roman invasions also made these people in the Middle East
lighter. Another fact we should not forget
is that the Moors
and Arabs from North Africa captured and raped Kuropean
women. As a
result, the North
Africans became
lighter. At
one lime, these people in North Africa and the Middle East
were
all
black. Whites have intermingled
their blood with
blacks in Asia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere. In spite
of this, the 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 35 ===
colored people of the world control about
three-
fourths of the earth's geographical area. Because the colored
people of the world are
in a majority,
it
is proper
to infer
that
the whites have always been a minority, and
that
the
black people are the original people of humanity.
It
is
interesting
and
meaningful
to
learn
that
the
Japhites
(Europeans)
traveled northwest, north, and north-
east of the mountainous region of the Caucasus into F.urope.
It gives me the impression that the Japhites were isolated, or
that they isolated themselves from the civilization and domi-
nation of Nimrod, which began in the land of Mesopotamia.
When the
Japhites separated
at
the "Tower of Babel,"
the theory and probability
is that they turned white. There
are many cases of individuals turning white in Jewish bibli-
cal history. When God wanted to show Moses a miracle, He
turned

then
he

rael, when
a man had a white spot in his skin, or white or yellow hair,
or white
skin somewhat
reddish,
he
was pronounced
un-
clean. 10 All
people who were
victims
of
this shameful
dis-
ease were isolated outside of the camp or city. 17 Those that
had leprosy were called lepers and
they had
to shout "un-
clean, unclean.
,|8 All people in the ancient world who had
yellow hair and leprosy were despised and segregated. This
is one reason the white supremists discriminate against
the
black people today. Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses
and defamed his character because he married an Ethiopian
woman. As a punishment, God struck Miriam with
leprosy
and she turned "white as snow." 10 Now, many people have
deceived
themselves
in
thinking
that
Miriam
and
Aaron
spoke against her because she was a black woman;
but
this
is not the case, because Miriam, Aaron, and Moses were
all
black people. They spoke against Moses because the
Ethio-
pian woman was of a different religion. The color issue did

in their day.
To
prove
this
point,
the
Israelites

the
Hamites
(Canaanites, Hittites, Anionics, Perizzites,
Hivites,
and
Jebusites).
They
intci -married.
"All
the
children
of
Israci did evil
in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim"
(the idol god). Because they served the idol, Baalim, the God
of Israel became angry and sold them into slavery.
It was the
worshiping
of
the
idols,
not
the
marriages
that God
dis-
approved.
Marriages
were
forbidden
because God
feared
that the alien races would persuade the Israelites to worship
their
idols; but
in Moses' case, he had converted the Ethio-
pian woman
to
his
religion.
Miriam and Aaron
used
the
Kthiopian woman as an excuse to challenge Moses' authority.
It was a family dispute of jealousy among the three of them. 20
Moreover, Miriam and Aaron were older than Moses. They
said, "Hath
the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath
He
not spoken
also by
us?" And
the
Lord heard
it. 21

idea was adopted by the Hebrews and
then
transmitted
to
the Greeks, Romans, and other Europeans.
The
literature
of
the
Babylonians

Long ago these black people wrote with
a sharp instrument
on clay tablets. Thousands of these tablets have been found;
and some
of them
disclose
a popular work known
as
the

the Creation

the
world began derived from the Babylonians.
After the dispersal of mankind
at the "Tower of Babel,"
the black Hamites migrated toward
the
east,
south, south-
west, and the west. 8 These black Hamites settled in the land
of Canaan

There were eleven Canaanitc tribes living in

The
greatest
cultural
and
commercial
cities
of
these
black Canaanites were Tyre and Sidon, sometimes written
Zidon.
This city gets
its name from Sidon, the first-born son
of Canaan.' The
Sidonians and
the Tynans
were
of
the
same
race, and
their kings ruled over both of these
cities.8
In many

Phoenicians

but
the

that Phoenician and Hebrew,
though different dialects, may practically be regarded as the

it was previously stated, there were eleven
Canaanite
tribes:
Sidonians,
Hittites,
Jebusitcs,
Amoritcs,
Cirgasites,
Hivites,
Ai kites,
Sinites,
Arvadites,
Zemarites
Hid the Hamathites." Hebrew has its origin in the Canaanite
language.'- When Abraham tune from the region of Babylon
into the land of Canaan, 13 he found the Canaanite language
similar
to
his own language. Abraham communicated
very
well
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
land,
adopted
the
Canaanite language, made certain
modifications, and
it
be-

as
Hebrew. The Hebrew
language was very
similar to the Canaanite says the Bible Dictionary. 14 Phoeni-
cian or Canaanite can
be
classified
as an
African
language
because the Canaauites were blood brothers of the Egyptians,
Ethiopians,
Nubians, Sudanese, and
other
Africans. 15 The
Phoenicians established a colony in north Africa called Car-

(the Carthaginians) always considered them-
selves Canaauites. 16
When Moses led the black Israelites out of Pgypt
(north-
cast Africa), Moses died in the wilderness. Then Joshua led
the
Israelites into the land of Canaan and dispossessed
the
Canaauites. Now,
it
is written
in
a Jewish book called the
Babylonian Talmud:
For when
the Africans came
to plead
against
the Jews

of Maredon,
they
said Canaan

to
us, as
it is written, the land of Canaan with the coast thereof:
and Canaan was
the
ancestor
ol
these
people
(ourselves).
These Canaanitcs or Africans were driven out of
the land
of Canaan by Joshua. About 332
B.C. Alexander conquered
Palestine. As stated above,
the Africans came
to Alexander
claiming that the land of Canaan belonged
to them. 17 The
point that

that these Canaanitcs con-

island
of
Crete.
( hie
is:
"It was to Crete that Zeus
(father of the gcxls)
abducted the Phoenician princess Europa and there fathered
three sons upon her." 27 Zeus came
in
the form of a
white
bull and abducted a black princess, because
the Phoenicians
were a black people. Some scholars believe
that
before

Herbert Wcndt

that
the name Europe
is
derived
from the Semitic word ereb. He said that the ancient Asiatics
considered
the word ereb
to
be something
dark,

and mysterious, and
therefore, Europe50 was

Originally
;ill Hamites and Shemites
(or Semites) were

1 Abraham was a black Shemite and
a
descendant
of
Slicin. 2 The name
of Abraham
was Abram
before he
was
referred
to as Abraham. The three Hebrew patriarchs were
Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. This Jacob begot
twelve
sons,
who later fathered the twelve tribes of
Israel. Abraham was
the father not only of the Hebrew-Israelite nation, but also
of the Arab nation.
Now, the mother and grandmother of the Arabian nation
were black Ilamite Egyptian women,3 and the fathers of the
Arabian
nation were Abraham and
Ishmael
(black Shem-
itcs).

method.
After Joseph was sold down
into
Egypt
as
a
slave, we
find
in
the forty-second chapter of Genesis
that he has be-
come the viceroy of Egypt. Joseph's ten brothers came into

into Egypt had
to buy corn from
Joseph;
but when Joseph's
ten
brothers
came
to
Africa
they did not
recogni/e him. They did
not
recognize him because Joseph had grown up and
the Egyp
tians were a black people like the sons of Jacob. Jacob's ten
sons considered Joseph
to be another
black
Egyptian. We
know this to be true because the ten brothers returned and
reported
to their father: "The man who
is the
lord of the
land spoke roughly lo us.
.
.
. "° Furthermore,
if Joseph had
been
white
he
would
have
aroused
the
curiosity
of
his
brothers very rapidly. We really do not need any more proof
that the Israelites were black; but for the sake of argument,
1
will offer
it.
In many
places in
the Bible we
find
the sons
of Jacob
and
the
later
Israelites taking black Canaanite women
for
wives.
If
the ancient
Israelites were
not
originally
black,
they would be after the intermingling with black Canaanite
men and women.
When the king (Pharoah) of Egypt promu

==================================================

=== CHUNK 54 ===
lgated an edict
to
cast
all
the Hebrew male
babies
into
the
Nile
River,
Miriam and
her mother hid
the baby
Moses
in
a
basket
alongside
the
river.
Meanwhile,
Pharoah's daughter came
down to the Nile to wash herself, and she saw the basket and
the baby,
Moses.
Pharoah's
daughter knew
that
the baby
was a Hebrew and she adopted him.
If Moses had been
a
white baby,
it would have been difficult to conceal him from
her father's anger.
In the period of Moses,
the black
Egyp-
tians enslaved black Jews.
Another point
to prove
that the Jews were black
is the
leprosy laws, written
in the thirteenth chapter of Leviticus,
and

strangest and most amazing phenomena concerning biblical
leprosy was
that
the skin turned white. These laws of
lep-
rosy were given
to the nation
of
Israel and
they could not
apply to a white nation.
Herbert Wcndt wrote in
his book,
It Began
in Babel:
"All indications point to the fact that Asia was t

the black
race." 7
It
is written
in
the book
of Daniel
7:9:
"I
beheld
till
the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did
sit,
whose garment was white as snow, and
the hair of his head
like pure wool:
his throne was
like
the
fiery
flame, and
his
wheels as burning
fire."
The meaning of
this verse
is as follows:
"I
beheld
till
the thrones were cast down." The thrones were placed down
and erected, "And the Ancient of days did
sit.'* The God of
the universe
is
the Ancient of days who
sat on
the
throne.
"And
the hair of
his head
like pure wool."
Daniel saw an
anthropomorphic form
of God judging
the
nations
in
the
appearance of a venerable man with woolly hair like a black
man. Daniel, the prophet, and the people in his environment
(the
Babylonians)
must
have had
woolly
hair
for him
to
dream
of God having woolly hair.

SUMMARY
There
is more than enough evidence
to prove
that
all
the original
Israelites were black, including the surrounding
nations
in
the Middle
Fast: we must consider the evidence
that the Dr.ividians were the original black people of India:
that the Cushites (Ethiopians) inhabited the southern Meso-
potamia!)
Valley;
that Abraham and
Ishtnael married
Afri-
can women
(Egyptians);
that the Canaanites belong
to the
African
family of nations;
that ancient
Israel
intermarried
36
From Babylon to Timbuktu
with
these black Cannanitc
tribes;
at the lime
that Joseph
was viceroy of Egypt his brothers could not distinguish him
from
the black
Egyptians because Joseph was
black;
after
Pharaoh promulgated the cruel decree
to extirpate the He-
brew males, only a black Moses would have been able to be
concealed
effectively
for any
length
of
time among
black
Egyptians;
that
Daniel
had
a dream
of an anthropomor-
phous God with
woolly
hair;
that
biblical

the time could apply only to a very dark people with black
hair. The
black Jews
of
India,
Abyssinia
(Ethiopia), and
West Africa consider themselves
the original Jews because
of the purity of their Israelite blood;
this has been stated by
Allen H. Godbey. 10
Now we know that Asia was the birthplace of the black
race. How did
these people
in Asia become lighter in com-
plexion? There are
five answers
to
this
question:
(1)
The
Indo-European
invasion or Germanic invasion of
Asia,
(2)
The Greek
invasion
of the Middle
East,
(3) The Roman
invasion
of
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa,
(4)
Tiie
Jewish slave trade, and
(5) The Arab slave trade. The Indo-
European
invaders penetrated
the Middle
East and mixed
with black Asiatics as
far away
as India during the second
millennium
is.c. The
European
Scythians
passed
through
.southern
Russia and Central Asia
as
far as
the bordets
of
China. 11

married colored women. The Jews sold white slaves 13 to the
Arabs throughout Africa and
Asia. When the black Moors
from
North
Africa
conquered
Portugal
and
Spain,
they
transported thousands of white slaves of Germanic descent
to
Africa.u
All
of
these
white
people who came or were
brought
to Africa and
Asia were absorbed
into
the
native
population.

BLACK ARABS, BLACK JEWS, AND ETHIOPIANS
Arabia, the land of the offspring of Ishmacl, the son of
Abraham,
is bordered on the east by the Indian Ocean, on
the northeast by the Persian Gulf, on the north by the Ara-
bian
Desert, and on
the west by
the Red Sea. The most
fertile region of
this peninsula
is the south and southwest.
At one point
it almost reaches Ethiopia, which
is in Africa.
There were many Cushite
tribes
(Ethiopians) living
in
the
northern, 15 western and southern
111 sections of Arabia. The
Arabians have had a
long
history
of
intercourse
with
the
Ethi

=== CHUNK 59 ===
opians
in
the
peninsula
of Arabia and with
the
Ethi-
opians across the Red Sea in the continent of Africa. James
Bruce
(author of Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile)
says that the people
in Yemen, Arabia, particularly those of
the coast opposite Saba
(Sheba), were reputed
Abyssinians
(Ethiopians) from
the earliest periods
till after the Moslem
conquest.'
7 Many of the Arabs are not black today because
of
the crossing with while slaves
in
their households and
harems. 18
It
is a known
fact that there were Ethiopians inhabiting
Arabia
in the north, southwest, and the southeast. Mow did
these
Ethiopians
establish
domicile
(residence)
in
south-
west Arabia? Because Ethiopians
lived around
the
Persian
Gulf
in
northern
Arabia,
it
is
highly
probable
that
they
migrated toward the southeast and the southwest.
It
is obvi-
ous that the Cushites inhabited vital parts of Arabia before
the birth of the progenitors of the Arabs. Raamah,
the son
of Cush, was
the
father
of
the Cushite Sheba and 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 60 ===
Dedan
(Gen.
10:7); about 2300
B.C. The tribe of Raamah became
remarkable
merchants
(Ezek.
27:22). The
descendants
of
Raamah
lived
in southeast Arabia, and
the descendants
of
Havilah resided in southwest Arabia, which
is Yemen. This
Havilah
was
the
son
of
Cush.
Moreover,
Cush
was
the
patriarch
of
all
the Ethiopian
tribes
in
Babylon,
Arabia,
India and on
the Nile
River. The Cushites were residents

of Arabia soon after the confusion of the tongues at Babylon
(2247
B.C.), but
Ishmael,
the
father
of
the Arabs, was not
horn
until
1 890
n.c. My conclusion
is
that
the
Ethiopians
were in Arabia before the Arabs.
In
the year
1012
n.c. an
Ethiopian queen named
Bilkis
visited King Solomon
in Jerusalem." Bilkis 30 came from the
Kingdom
of Sheba
in southern
Arabia. Sheha was
part
of
the Ethiopian empire.
This empire included Upper Egypt,
Ethiopia, and
parts
of Arabia, 21 which
included
the
King-
dom of Sheba,
The Jewish historian, Elavius
Josephus, calls
this queen
the Qu

=== CHUNK 61 ===
een of Egypt and Ethiopia. 2 " Calling this
queen the Queen of Ethiopia
is proper when you know the
historical . background and
genealogy
of
the
early
inhabi-
tants of Arabia. The Queen of Sheba
is known also as
the
Queen of the South. The Kingdom of Sheba and Ethiopia"
was one empire 24 to the south of the Land of Israel. We must
remember that, on
the map, Yemen, Arahia almost touches
Ethiopia in Africa.
It
is obvious
that
the Queen
of Sheba had more
than
one name,
because she
is known
to
the
Ethiopians by
the
name Makcda. 2" Nevertheless,
it
is not strange
that she had
more than one name. The
Ethiopian story
of Mekeda,
the
Queen
of Sheba,
is transmitted
to us from
the
Abyssinian
archives. This important document
is known as the "Kebra
Nagast" or "honor of the Kings." The Ethiopian account
re-
lates
the
itinerary of the Queen
of Ethiopia
to meet King
Solomon
in Jerusalem. She came with a great train, a retinue

e became
infatuated
with
King Solomon
because of the organization of his affairs, his wealth, his wis-
dom, his understanding, and physical appearance. Moreover,
the story relates that King Solomon fathered a child by the
Queen of Ethiopia;
this child was called David or Menilek
I. 28
The Queen returned to Sheba
(or Saba) with Menilek
I.
Alter Menilek had remained in Ethiopia for some years, his
mother sent him
to King Solomon
to be educated. Menilek
The Original Black Jews

was crowned
King
of
Ethiopia
in
Jerusalem, and
at
that
time he accepted the name David. Many experts in
the law
of Moses, especially one from each

to
Ethiopia
in order
to be judges
in

From
these
experts,

"all
the adjacent nations agree with

osed on the
Jews were
so
great
that
a
large number of Jews
fled
into
Arabia. The
tradition
of
the
colored
Yemenite
Jews
of
Arabia
relates
that
the
first Jews came
to Arabia with
the
prophet,
Jeremiah,
just
before Nebuchadnezzar
destroyed
the
First Temple.
In considering the Jews of Arabia, we cannot forget the
Jews
that accompanied
the Queen
of Sheba and
her
son,
Menelik
I.
It
is
obvious from many
indications
that
the
Queen
of Sheba
or
her
son,
Menelik,
transferred 20
their
capital from Sheba to Ethiopia in Africa; or that they had a
second capital
at Aksum, Ethiopia, on
the order of
a sum-
mer
residence.
It
is
not
exactly known when
the
capital
was transferred or when Aksum came into prominence as a
Jewish
state, but
it
probably occurred
between
the
years
090 and 575
B.C. At
this
last date
the
Persians conquered
Arabia, resulting in the immigration of more Sabacans and
Habashitcs
(Abyssinians) into Ethiopia. Many of the leaders
and inhabitants of
this Aksumite
state became Jewish and


==================================================

=== CHUNK 66 ===
seized
political domination of ancient
Ethiopia, called Ak-
sum. The Aksumite Empire was ruled by Himyaritic immi-
grants 27 from Arabia,
1st and 2nd centuries
A.n. According
to tradition, the
religious center contained
the Ark of the
Covenant brought from Jerusalem by the offspring of King
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
Basil
Davidson
said
that
the
great
period
of
Ethiopia
began soon
after
a.d. 50 when Aksum became
the
capital
of a new line of kings. 28
It
is obvious that these kings were
Jews.
The success of trade monopoly in ancient times, on both
sides of the Red Sea between Africa and Arabia, meant

is the reason
Ethiopia and southern Arabia were included in one empire.
There was much commercial rivalry between Saba
(Sheba),
Himyar, 20 Habcsh30 and Aksum that resulted in many wars.
All of the kings and many of the inhabitants of these cities
were Jewish
at one time or another. Professor Godbey
says
th

at
it
is an outstanding point of the tradition going back to
Solomon's time, for both Abyssinia and Yemen, that ancient
Hebrew kings on both
sides of
the Red Sea had
the
title
"Bar Negash" or "Sea Kings." 31 The later Himyarite kings,
after 250
B.C., controlled both
sides of the Red
Sea. When
the prosperous Himyarite kings changed their religion, they
attached
the
pretext
of religious extremism
to
the
reasons
for waging war against their commercial
rivals. The
King-
doms of Raidan and Himyar were united against Habcsh,
Sheba, and Hadramaut about 500
B.C. The rivalries between
these alliances brought the Roman
fleet into military move-
ment
in the Arabian Gulf about
1
B.C.
to capture
the port
of Aden. When the Roman power declined there were Jew-
ish kings in Hadramaut, Sheba, and Yemen continuing the
economic rivalries in
trade. During the
first, second,
third,
fourth, and
fifth centuries, Judaism was politically powerful
in Arabia. This power was predicated on
trade monopoly.

THE GENESIS OF CHRISTIANITY IN
ETHIOPIA AND ARABIA
About a.d. 329, a group of Tynans
(Phoenicians) were
embarked
for
India. Their ship met
disaster
off
the shore
of
Ethiopia, and
the only
survivors were
the two
sons
of
the leader. These boys were captured by the Ethiopians and
taken to the court of the king.
Frumentius,
one
of
the
boys,
became
instructor
to
Abraha, the prince. Abraha
later became king of
Ethiopia.
42
From Babylon tu Timbuktu
Erumentious
taught
Christianity
to Crown
Prince Abraha
and
others. Erumentius
traveled
to
the
Byzantine
Empire
(Eastern Roman
Empire). He
had
an
audience
with
the
temporal head, Constantinc the Great, and the ecclesiastical
head,
St. Athanasius. The leaders of the empire were so
tre-
mendously impressed with his abilities that they aided him.
Frumentius was promoted
to
the
status of bishop and
re-
turn

==================================================

ed
to
Ethiopia. The bishop erected and
established
a
church
in
Ethiopia
with
the
support
of
the
new
king,
Abraha.
By
Abraha's
confession
of
Christianity,
he
became
a
J udco Christian. He was
eager
for
the
spread
of
his new
faith into the land of his ancestors, 33 the Arabian peninsula.
Gathering
a
military
expedition
of
Ethiopians,
Abraha
crossed
the Red Sea with
his naval
forces and army. He de-
feated
the
black Arabs and conquered
the
pagan
city
of
Mecca
after
a
long
siege.
After
lie had
introduced
Chris-
tianity
into
Arabia,
Abraha
returned
to
his
capitol
at
Aksum,
Ethiopia.
By the early part of the sixth century a.d. Jewish power
in Yemen had reached
its zenith.
This power was dominant
in Yathrcb,
later called
Medina.

Dhu Nuwas3 ' was one of
these Arabs who converted
to
Judaism. He was
the king
of Yemen about
f>00
a.d. The
Jewish sages were invited to teach Judaism
to the people
at
large. When Dhu Nuwas heard that the Jews were being per-
secuted
in
the
Byzantine
Empire,
he
retaliated by
killing
some Byzantine merchants and 20,000 Christians
in
Arabia.
This unwise act brought about
the
fall
of the Jewish
king-
dom. Judaism was not destined
to be disseminated
in
that
manner. "Not

The Christians,
in
their
terrible hour of despair, made
an earnest appeal
to the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire
at
Constantinople,
but Justinian
was
hesitant
to
mobilize
a military forte because of previous Roman defeats in Arabia.
The Emperor was
advised by
the Abouna
(Patriarch)
of
the Coptic Church
in
Alexandria,
Egypt,
to appeal
to
St.
Elesbaan, the Emperor of Ethiopia. St. Elcsbaan received the
envoys and promised

the Christians85
in Yemen.
St.
Elesbaan organized and mobilized an army of more
than 65.000 Africans. He appointed one of his most sagacious
generals. Abraha,
to be
his commander. Abraha
transnavi-
gated
the Red Sea with
150 ships and a
large company
of
elephants. When
the two opposing
forces confronted
each
other,
the Jews were
defeated, and
the
triumphant
Ethio-
pians inarched
to Zhafar and captured
it.
The
Ethiopians ruled over Arabia
at
this time with an
iron hand.
Abraha,
the
Ethiopian, constructed
a marvelous temple
at Saan.i in order to attract the pilgrims
(pagan Arabs) who
passed through
this conquered country on their way
to the
temple at Mecca. Moreover, Abraha devised outlandish and
additional inducements in order to entice the Arabs not
to
go to Mecca.
One of the Arabs considered Abraha's actions
to be an
affront
to
his
religion. As a
result, he placed dung on
the
altar of Abraha's temple.
Abraha's reactions were immediate and vigorous
to
the
sacrilege
of
this pagan Ar

==================================================

=== CHUNK 72 ===
ab. Abraha equipped an army of
41,000 men, horsemen, and armored elephants and marched
to
Mecca
to
destroy
the
temple.
Before Abraha
reached
Mecca, his army was badly battered by a sandstorm. In addi-
tion
to
this, small-pox broke out
in
his
forces.
In
spite of
these
difficulties,
the general reached Mecca with adequate
forces to intimidate the inhabitants of the city. They capitu-
lated and opened the city gates.
When Abraha was riding under the archway of the city
gates, his white elephant remained in one spot and would not
44

move. Because of this, rejoicing broke out among the Arab-
ians. Recognizing an act of God, they assailed the Ethiopians
violently and transformed the history of the world. Abraha
departed from
Mecca and
died
of
small-pox and
mortifi-
cation.
Because of the obstinacy of Abraha's elephant, the Arabs
have called this period, "The Era of the Elephant," and only
the birth of Mohammed
is considered more important.

THE BIRTH OF ISLAM
At the time of the birth of Mohammed, what were the
international events or conditions operating? The answer to
this question
is necessary for a comprehension of the rapid
emergence
of the Mohammedan Empire.
The Roman
empire,
at
the
birth
of Mohammed,
was
divided into two parts: The Western Empire with the capi-
tal at Rome and the Byzantine Empire with
the
capital
at
Constantinople.
The Roman Empire in the west collapsed a.d. 476 after
many barbarian raids and incursions. The Germanic
tribes
crossed the borders and penetrated into
all
the
territory of
the Western Empire, including Africa.86
The
Eastern Empire
was deprived
of
its
vigor by
re-
peated wars with
Parthia
(Persia). This empire could not
hold
its possessions with a
firm
grip.

with

wars
brought disorder, and weakened both the Western and East-
ern Empires.
With the defeat of Jewish and Christian power in Arabia,
the stage was now set for
the
rise of
a new power on
the
world scene;
this new power was Arabia. The Arabian Em-

pire, with
its new
religion
(Islam),
established
the
super-
structure of
its culture on
the ruins of the Roman Empire
in
the Middle
East,
Africa, and
parts of Europe. 37
Europe remained dormant and
inactive
for a thousand
years
(through
the Dark Ages) while the Moslem
Empire
mastered the civilized progressive world. Let us return, now,
to survey
the
rise
of
the Moslem
religion and empire
in
Arabia.
When Mohammed was born many Arabs were still wor-
shiping
the
sun,
stars,
spirits, and
idols. The
Arabs
pos-
sessed
three hundred and
sixty
idols, one
for each day
of
the year.

of
Koreish and the family of Hashem. His mentality was prodi-
gious.
In
his youth he was never taught to read or write,39
but
his
imagination
was
superlative. Mohammed
was
an
extraordinarily handsome man, and eloquent
in motivating
men with the power of words.
In the early years of Mohammed's life, he passed his time
as a shepherd boy. We must remember that many successful
men have arisen from
insignificant and humble conditions.
Watching the sun by day and the
stars by night

tunity for Mohammed to contemplate in solitude, and reflect
on the events and profundities of this world.

ing the tenets of their religions. He frequented the environ-

ly because they were
merchants and
an

ethnic
group.
Because
he
could not read or write, his ears were attentive and keen
to
everything that the Jews related to him. Mohammed learned
and
extracted much
from
the
Jewish
religion,
and
com-
pounded
it with
his new
religion,
Islam.

From Babylon to Timbuktu
When
Kadijali, a rich widow, heard of the good reputa-
tion of Mohammed) she employed him
in her business. He
went on a business deal, transacted
it with good results, and
returned home at an advantageous time.
Mohammed was amazed at the beauty of Kadijah. He had
not seen her before because he had received his position by
proxy. Kadijah was immensely gratified by the way he con-
ducted her
affairs, and
the manner
in which he presented
himself to her.
Mohammed was not a
tall man, but he had such broad
shoulders that he looked like a giant. Mohammed had curly
black
woolly
hair
that gave him an
excellent
appearance.
Finally, Mohammed married
Kadijah,

of Mecca, when she was about
forty years old.
THE FIRST STAGE OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
According to Alvin L. Bertrand, 49 most mass movements
pass through four stages or phases to complete a whole cycle,
but
Eric Hoffer, the longshoreman,
postulates three stages:
the vocal stage, the fanatical stage, and the stage of the prac-
tical men of action.
Mohammed
spent many
days
in
the
hills
outside
of
Mecca. He was immersed deeply
in
the deplorable condi-
tions of his people and he wanted to lead them away from
moral
turpitude and
idolatry.
It seemed
to him
that
the
angel Gabriel appeared, commissioning him
to articulate a
new religion
to substitute for the old. Incidentally, Gabriel
was the same angel who appeared in
a vision to the Hebrew
prophet,
Daniel.''
Mohammed
gradually came
to
believe
that he was a prophet, and expounded his religion
to mem-
bers
of
his
family. He went out
to
the
Holy Temple
to
preach
to the multitudes that gathered
to worship the
idols.
With
these words the
first 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 78 ===
phase of the
Islamic Revolution
began: La ilaha
ilia Allah, Mohammed rasul Allah!
(There
is no god but
Allah, and Mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
Allah!)
The Original Black Jews
47
Incidentally, by
this time
the Hebrew Old Testament
had been translated into Arabic, and the Arabs were raptur-
ously pleased to read about their great ancestors in the story
of
the
Hebrew
patriarchs.4'
This
fact
alone
helped
Mo-
hammed to inspire in
the Arabs
the feeling of nationalism
and
racial
pride,
because
they
had
read
in
the Hebrew
Scripture that Ishmael was
to become a "great nation." 42
Mohammed masterminded
the
first stage
of
his revolu-
tion by undermining and discrediting prevailing established
beliefs and customs and questioning other
political,
social,
and
religious
institutions. Mohammed
attacked
the
mer-
chants
and
rulers
in
Mecca who
employed
the
well
of
Ishmael and
the Kaaba
(temple)
for monetary
gain.
Not
only did he speak out against idolatry, but also against gam-
bling and drunkenness. Beca

==================================================

=== CHUNK 79 ===
use he spoke against
the wine
enterprises in
the
city
of Taif, Mohammed was compelled
to leave the city.
When Mohammed
returned
to
the
city
of Mecca,
the
opposition was intensified against
him. A
law was enacted
that anybody who accepted
Islam would be
exiled. When
the
leaders
of
the
city of Mecca were
informed
that Mo-
hammed was gaining converts in Yathrib, they conspired to
assassinate him. This conspiracy motivated Mohammed
to
flee from Mecca to Yathrib. The night of Mohammed's flight
to Yathrib
(later called Medina, the city of the prophet)
is
known as the Hegira, the flight.
The Mohammedan Calendar commences with the year of
the Hegira.
It
is the most important event in Islamic history.
The Hegira occurred ad.
fi22 when Mohammed was
fifty-
three years of age.
Coming
to
Yathrib, Mohammed found
the
inhabitants
very hospitable to him and to his new religion. There were
two
factors
that contributed
to
this
hospitality:
(I) There
were many influential Jews in Yathrib who were
allies w

ith
the other Arabs. These Jews had introduced the conception
of one God.
Moreover,
the Arabs were somewhat
tolerant
of the Jews.
(2) on a pilgrimage
to
the temple
in Mecca,
48
From Babylon to Timbuktu
some of Yathrib's best
citizens had been converted by
the
teachings of Mohammed when he
lived
in Mecca.
Finally,
the pilgrims returned to Yathrib and disseminated their new
religion. These converts could readily accept Islam because
they were influenced to a great extent by the concept of the
one God
of
the
Jews.
Eventually, Mohammed
was
pro
claimed
ruler of
the
city, and
in
his honor,
the name
of
Yathrib was changed to Medina.
ISLAM AND JUDAISM
The prophet Mohammed adopted many
principles and
laws from
the Jewish religion: 43
first
of
all,
the basic
idea
of monotheism, which
is the belief in one God. The Jewish
confession of the unity of God
is: Shma Israel Adonai Elo-
henu Adonai ehad!
(Hear, oh
Israel, the Lord our God the
Lord
is one!) The Mohammedan slogan
is as
follows: La
ilaha
il

==================================================

=== CHUNK 81 ===
ia Allah, Mohammed rasul Allah!
(There
is no god
but Allah, and Mohammed
is the prophet of Allah!)
Mohammed adopted, also, the main details of the Jewish
Calendar, the Day of Atonement, 44 the Sabbath, much of the
Bible, and
narratives from
the Medrash, and many points
of the ritual
law. Incidentally,
the Jews pray
three times a
day facing the city of Jerusalem, and the Moslems
(true be-
lievers) pray five times a day facing the city of Mecca.
Trying his best, Mohammed sought to convert the Jews
to his new religion, but to no avail. The Jews were adamant
and resistant to change. The high esteem which the Prophet
held for the Jews was transformed to enmity, and instead of
allies,
he
looked upon
them
as
competitors. Mohammed
needed the confirmation
of the
influential Jews
to validate
his mission, as
all upstarts need the backing of someone in-
fluential.
Mohammed,
therefore,
turned
against
the
Jews
and became
their tormentor.
The Original Black Jews
49
THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF JUDAISM
The
of

==================================================

=== CHUNK 82 ===
fspring
of Judaism
are
Christianity and
Islam.
Now history was repeating
itself! The proponents of Chris-
tianity said
to the Jews, we accept your Bible, morals, and
monotheism. Only,
receive from
us Jesus Christ,
the great
Prophet, the Messiah, of whom all the prophets spoke in the
Scripture. Because the Jews refused, they were despised and
hated.
Mohammed
tried
to construct
his religion
as
closely
as
he could after the Jewish religion. He favored
the Jews by
accepting many of their laws and traditions. When the Jews
refused
to be
converted,
he commanded
his
followers
to
stop turning to the Holy City of Jerusalem
in
prayer, but
rather to turn to the city of Mecca. He changed the Jewish
Yom Kippur
(the Day of Atonement or Fast Day), which
he had accepted
for
the month
of Ramadan. Mohammed
changed
the
Jewish Sabbath from
Saturday
to Friday. We
have another' parallel with
Christianity. In
the fourth
cen-
tury, the Church changed the Sabbath to Sunday and reor-
ganized
its
calendar
to mak

==================================================

=== CHUNK 83 ===
e
Easter
separate
of
Passover.
Like
Christianity,
also. Mohammed
included
in
his
Bible
(the Koran)
accusations concerning the Jews.
Nevertheless,
the Koran
glorifies many
biblical
personalities.
In order to win the pagans into the Church, Christianity
adopted many
barbaric
customs
and
traditions.
Likewise
Mohammed, to gain the loyalty of the pagan Arabs, adopted
many of their beloved customs. The Kaaba Stone
(an
idol)
was to receive high regard in the new religion; also the pagan
temple at Mecca was to remain as a holy sight.
THE SECOND STAGE OF THE
ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
I
The fanatical stage of most revolutions
is a bestial, ruth-
less, bloody, chaotic affair. The throats of men are cut from
50
From Babylon to Timbuktu
"car
to
car." There
is an
absence
of
rationalization
and
extreme fanaticism sets
in.
So
it was with Mohammed. He had come
to
a point of
no return. He became a religious extremist
in order to give
his people a better
life on a rapid
scale. Mohammed came
to the conclusion
th

==================================================

=== CHUNK 84 ===
at
all means of persuasion had been
ex-
hausted. The period
of patience was
past and he was now
determined to propagate his religion by
the sword. For he
said:
"I,
last of
the prophets, am
sent
with
a sword! The
sword
is the key to heaven and
hell. All who draw
it
in the
name of the Faith will be rewarded!" Mohammed became a
martial prophet, and the pagans and stubborn Jews became
his victims.
In
the
year G27
the
Battle
of
the
Foss occurred. The
Jewish
tribes were defeated by
the
armies
of Mohammed.
Seven hundred Jews were gathered in the market place and
offered
the alternative "the Koran or
the sword." Rut
the
devout Jews were accustomed
to martyrdom. They did not
hesitate
in
their choice. Mohammed carried out
his
bestial
threat, executed the Jews, and the women were sold.
There
was
another
city
northeast
of
Medina
called
Chaibar. This city was the headquarters of Jewish power in
Arabia.
After
a
long
siege,
the
city
capitulated
to
Mo-
hammed. Under the rulcrship of Omar, the Jews of 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 85 ===
Chaibar
were transplanted
to Syria.
Mohammed attacked tribe after
tribe and caravan
after
caravan
that were going
to
the
city
of Mecca. These
acts
enraged the Meccans and they equipped a large army to de-
stroy Mohammed. In the ensuing battle Mohammed was al-
most
killed.
Finally,
the prophet marshaled
his
forces and
entered the city of Mecca. The entire city was abandoned
because
its
inhabitants
were
afraid
of Mohammed.
Mo-
hammed decimated the idols in Mecca. However, he did not
demolish
the Temple. When
the
Meccans
saw
that
Mo-
hammed did not destroy their Temple, they returned to the
city and joined his religion.

The third stage of any revolution
is marked by the pres-
ervation and continuation of the new order.
The
successor
of Mohammed was Abu
Bekr;
he
was
called Caliph. Abu Bekr wrote down
the speeches and
ser-
mons of Mohammed. By
this time,
Islam
held a tenacious
grip over the lives of the Arabians.

embark on our voyage
into African
civiliza-
tion,
I think (hat
it would be interesting to the readers and
students
of African
history
to know how
the continent of
Africa received
its name.
First of
all,
in
ancient
periods,
the black
Hebrews
re-
ferred
to Egypt
(the guardian
of
the northeastern
gate
of
Africa) as the Land of Ham. 1 The Hebrew ethnologists used
the eponymous name (Ham) because they were conscious of
the fact that many of Ham's descendants traveled from Asia
toward the south and inhabited the continent we know of
today as Africa.
It seems that there were no Semites or Indo-
Europcans in the Land of Ham
(Africa) before the enslave-
ment
of
the

Ancient
Palestine was part of the Land of Ham before the Hebrews

It appears that the early anthropologists and ethnologists
classified races on the basis of cultural development, and not
on the basis of kinship; but the Hebrews are an exception.

the Greeks
used
the word
Ethiopian.
Moreover,
the maps of Africa during the Middle Ages show
this conti-
nent
as
Ethiopia. Knowing
that
the greater part of Africa
was called Ethiopia, the professor of /oology and anthropol-
ogy, Johann

the modern name

It

Africa.
In the Latin language, the word for Africa

to Ophren

(or Aphcr).
The F in the word Afer
and the 1'h in Aphcr are interchangeable in many languages.
In
North
Africa,
(he Romans won
a

victory
(the period
of

Ostensibly,
the Ro-

called their country Apher.
The continent of Africa

How and where did Africa receive
its black population?
Did
it come from
the south,
the
east, the north,
the west,
across
the mighty oceans, or did
this population
originate
in
the interior of
the continent through
a gradual
process
of evolution? Herbert Wendt and
Basil Davidson say
that
it
presumably came
from
Mesopotamia
(Babylonia). The
history
of
the ancient
black Jews
indicates
that
the
early
patriarchs of the African people migrated from
Babylonia,

truth has become
lost
in the worship of many gods and
in
the deification of many kings.
Can we put any credence
in Jewish
records
that record
the ethnology and migrations of the ancestors of the Africans?
I think so, because Abraham came from the district of Baby-
lon, which was the cradle of civilization. Abraham had the
oral
traditions transmitted from Noah and Sliem. Abraham
rendered
obeisance
to
the
one
true
God;
therefore
his
descendants were able to transmit
a long uninterrupted
re-
ligion,
history,
culture, and
language. No other nation
in
the ancient Near East can boast or claim as much. Even
as
great
as Egypt
was, her ancient
religion and language are
now extinct.
The Hamites began to arrive in Africa from the Middle

EGYPT: THE LAND OF THE NILE
The
most
extraordinary
civilization
in
ancient
times,
at the western extremity of the Fertile Crescent, was that of
Egypt. What
conditions
contributed
to
Egypt's
greatness?
The factors that made possible the eminence of these black
56
From Babylon to Timbuktu
people
were
tlie
climatic
conditions and
geography. The
conditions that played
a great part
in
the development of
Egyptian civilization were the Nile River, a hot climate, an
outlet
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea and
the Red
Sea.
Egypt
is the Nile.
A
very
peculiar
fact about
Egypt
is
that
it
has
little
rain. The Nile River runs through
this country
for about
seven hundred and
fifty miles from
the highlands of
Ethi-
opia, overflowing
its banks once a year, during the summer
solstice. As the Nile
flows toward the Sea,
the water brings
down alluvial
deposits
of black earth, 9 making arable land
on both
sides of
the Nile
in
the Valley. The combination
of
fertile
soil,
the

==================================================

=== CHUNK 94 ===
 Nile
as an
irrigation
canal,
interacting
with
a hot climate, produced for Egypt huge quantities of
corn and grain, which helped to feed a growing urban popu-
lation and large armies. As a result of Egyptian prosperity,
we
find
the ancient Hebrews going down
to Egypt
to pur-
chase
corn. The
social
scientists know
that
in
order
to
achieve military expansion, economic development
is a pre-
requisite, and Egypt had solved
this problem
early
in
its
development.
The yearly flooding of the Nile over its banks contributed
a stimulus to learning, especially in astronomy and geometry.
The priests wanted to calculate the exact period of the flood-
ing of the Nile. In order to accomplish
this, the priests had
to observe the heavenly bodies. This involved mathematics
and they divided the year into twelve months of thirty days.
Our calendar of today
is patterned after the Egyptian calen-
dar.
Again, because the Nile overflowed
its banks,
this event

THE OLD KINGDOM
The history of the dynasties
in the civilization
of Egypt
may he divided into three periods

==================================================

=== CHUNK 96 ===
. They arc as follows:
the
Old Kingdom or Pyramid Age,
the Middle Kingdom, and
the New Kingdom or New Empire.
The
first king of the First Dynasty of the Old Kingdom
was
Mencs. The
date
of
his
accession
to
the
throne was
about 3500
B.C. He wore a unique double crown symboliz-
ing
the unity
of Upper and Lower Egypt. The snake was
the symbol
in the north, and
the hawk was
the symbol
in
the south.
By the time the Third Dynasty arrived, Egypt was well
on
her way
toward
greatness
(2980-2'JOO
B.C.). The
most
remarkable
king
at
this time was
Zoser. With
his power,
wealth, and the aid of his counselor, Imhotep, he promoted
the city of Memphis, expanded and strengthened the king-
dom,
built
tombs,
temples, and
terraced pyramids.
During the administration of King Zoser, there lived in
Egypt
the most phenomenal
intellectual
of
his
time. This
man was Imhotep, the master. He excelled in many academic
pursuits and was preeminent
in the
field of medicine. J. A.

says
that

Imhotcp examined
the

external
vital
organs
of
the

body.
Furthermore, he
investigated
the
circulatory
system.
Herodotus11
says
that
the
Egyptians were
specialists
in
the medical
field and
the country swarmed
with
medical
practitioners.
In his day, Imhotep was recognized, also, as a sage, priest,
philosopher,
poet,
scribe, magician, astronomer, and
archi-
tect.
EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY
In
the
Egyptian
pantheon
there were many gods. The
most famous gods were Osiris,
Isis, and Horns. These gods
formed
a
triad. The
principal
gods were
worshiped
in
a
triad;
the
number
three
apparently
had
a
mystical
im-
portance
to
the
Egyptians. Horus was
the son
of
the sun
god
(Osiris) and
the moon goddess
(Isis). The
triad
was
very

==================================================

=== CHUNK 98 ===
 common
in
the ancient world and
it
has come down
to our day.
Earlier, Osiris was the god of the Nile and
Isis
represented the god of the earth.
The Egyptians, also, worshiped the animals, nature, and
the
twelve gods:
Hercules 12 was one of
these
twelve
gods.
Herodotus, the Greek historian, says that the Greeks adopted
the
black god
(Hercules) from
the
Egyptians. When
the
Greeks and Romans took over the gods of Asia and Africa;
sometimes they changed their names and color.
Let us return now to our triad, Osiris,
Isis, and Horus.
1 think
that more than any other god,
the legend
of Osiris
underwent great transformation through the passage of
his-
tory. At
first,
I am certain, he was a subsidiary god, but he
arose to the status of a sun god. In Egyptian mythology the
legend
says
Osiris was
king of Egypt and
he
married
his
sister
Isis. When
Osiris went
off
to war,
his
brother,
Set,
assassinated him.
Set
eventually cut
the body
in
fourteen
pieces and scattered
it over a remote area.

Finally,
Isis brought forth a son after the death of her hus-

This posthumous birth was "conceived by

are voluminous and
interesting. They have
their counter-
parts in the East and the West, Babylon, Greece, and Rome.
From Greece and Rome, culture and civilization spread over
the entire continent of Europe.
Now, in order to terminate the history of the Old King-
dom,
it behooves me
to mention
the
fact that Khufu,
the
first
king
of
the
Fourth
Mcmphite
Dynasty,
erected
the
largest pyramid.
Pepi,
the
third and
greatest king
of
the
Sixth Dynasty
(2590-2570) sent some expeditions against the
Bedouins
of
Sinai and
into
Palestine;
nevertheless,
Egypt
was
set
for
a
period of decline.
Pepi
II
reigned 90
years
(2566-2470
B.C.), the longest reign recorded
in
history; gen-
erally an uneventful period of retrogression, with
the king
much of the time controlled by a powerful aristocracy. The
Old Kingdom and the
first thousand
years of recorded
his-
tory ends with the Eighth Dynasty. This was the beginning
of the period of excessive anarchy.

==================================================

=== CHUNK 102 ===
 The country was engaged
in a destructive civil war. There was a long wretched period
of disorder. Many
potentates claimed
the
throne
at
once,
and the cities were in an uproar with widespread confusion.
At
this same
time, black
Flamitic Anionics' 4 from
the
northern Euphrates River, invaded the Fertile Crescent and
the Egyptian
frontier. These
Asiatic Amorites,
also,
pene-
trated the booming towns of the Nile delta, spreading con-
sternation and panic.
THE MIDDLE KINGDOM
The Middle Kingdom consisted of nine dynasties lasting
for a period of a thousand
years. Because of the condition
of anarchy, the need of the hour was for strong leaders. This
leadership was found in
the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynas-
ties.
Mentuhotep
II completed
the conquest
of
the
Hera-
cleopolitan Dynasty. The capital of
this kingdom was trans-
ferred more than three hundred miles south of Memphis
to
the
city of Thebes. Obviously,
the capital was removed

Thebes so that
it would be

invaders. Once again the mighty pharaohs governed Upper
and Lower Egypt. When
the new kings had
restored
law,
order, and peace, the Egyptians devised more improvements
and public works.
Amcnemhet III of the Twelfth Dynasty
(1849-1801) and
other
pharaohs
established
dikes and
constructed
colossal
reservoirs
to preserve the water of the Nile for land
irriga-
tion. They dug
a channel
through
the
land
between
the
Nile
delta and
the Red
Sea. The
sophisticated
Egyptians
excavated canals
thousands
of years before
a French
engi-
neer (Dc Lcsseps) dug the Suez Canal a.d.
1869. The ancient
Egyptians were meticulous masters
in constructional
engi-
neering;
they were very accurate with
the smallest
details.
Thousands of slaves from
all over
the known world were

organized
monarchy. The
kings
had
diplomatic
relations
with
remote
kingdoms.
Sesostris
III,
fifth king of
the dynasty
(1887-1849
B.C.), conquered two
hundred miles of the Nile Valley up to the second cataract;
he established relations with
the
coast
of
the Red
Sea;
he
sent military expeditions into the Sinai peninsula and
also
into Syria. At
this time trade was successful on a
large scale.
During this Middle Kingdom, Egyptian civilization made-
its
first profound influence on other parts of Africa, such as
Nubia, Wawat, Cush, etcetera.
About
the time of
the reign
of Amenemhet IV
(1801-
1792
is.c.j and
the early stages
of
the Thirteenth
Dynasty,
Egypt went through a long period of confusion and invasion.
The
Egyptians were
so
tremendously
disunited
that
they
neglected
the defense
of
the kingdom.
It
collapsed
easily,
about 1788
B.C., before a wave of invaders known
as Hyksos
or
Shepherd
Kings.
These
Hyksos
dominated
Egypt
for
about
two
hundred
years.
This
period
is known
to
the
Egyptians

==================================================

=== CHUNK 105 ===

as the "Great Humiliation."
02
From Babylon to Timbuktu
Now, after long exhaustive investigation,
it appears
that
the Hyksos were descendants of the ancient Horitcs or Hur-
rians. A. T. Olmstcad 18 confesses that "there
is much obscurity
about their race. We may at
least assert that they were west
Semites and that their chief center of power was north Syria."
1 do not agree with Olmstcad when he says they are Semites,
however. Much
evidence
indicates
that
they
are
Japhitcs,
Indo Iranians or
Indo-Europeans,18 descendants
of what we
call today the white race. But
I agree with Olmstcad when
he says the center of
their power was
in
north
Syria. The
Humans came
from
the
southern
parts
of
the
Caucasus
Mountains and established their new capital
at Mitanni
in
Syria and Assyria. These Hurrians began to push
their way
into the black world of the Middle East about
1800
B.C.
Herbert
Wendt 17
writes
the
following:
"In
ancient
Sumcrian epics (he land of Churrum
is mentioned south of
the Caucasus, 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 106 ===
and in
the Old Testament
the Hurrians ap-
pear as the Chori
(or Horites).
In
1720
b.c. or thereabouts
they conquered, under the name
of Hyksos,
the Kingdom
of Egypt where they reigned
as Shepherd Kings."
When the Hurrians invaded the Middle
East, they were
a white or
fair-skinned
race. They mixed with
the
indige-
nous
black
population, and
took up permanent
residence
among
them.
Everywhere
they
traveled
they
established
colonics.
During
the second
millennium,
the Hurrians
invaded
Egypt under the name Hyksos. They came with horses and
chariots, which
terrified
the
Egyptians. The
Egyptians had
never seen
horses
before, and
the
Egyptians probably had
never before seen such a heterogeneous population of white,
yellow,
light brown, and
chocolate
people.
So
the
Hyksos
came into Egypt and established the Fifteenth and Sixteenth
Dynasties. These
dynasties
arc known
to
the
Egyptians
as
the period
of the "Great Humiliation." During
this period
the Egyptians had to suffer insults to their gods an

==================================================

d culture
from
aliens.
Many scholars think
that
the Hyksos were in power
in
Black Civilization in Africa
65
Egypt when the ancient Hebrews came down to
live and
to
purchase corn.
This would mean that the Hebrews migrated
to Egypt between
1788 and
1580. The Hyksos were
hospit-
able to the Hebrews because they were aliens themselves.
It
was one of the Hyksos pharaohs who elevated Joseph,
the
wise Hebrew,
to the position of
viceroy
of Egypt.
Because
of this, Joseph saved Egypt from starvation.
In
the process
of
time,
the
Egyptians from
the
city
of
Thebes, Upper Egypt, waged wars of liberation against
the
Hyksos.
The new
powerful
native
Egyptian
leader
advo-
cated an ardent
nationalist
policy
to regain
control
of the
government.
As
a
result,
the
Hyksos
were
expelled
from
Egypt.
THE NEW KINGDOM OR NEW EMPIRE
"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew
not
Joseph.
"And he said unto his people, behold, the people of the
children of Israel are more and mightier than wc.
"Come on,

ply, and
it come
to
pass, when
there
falleth out any war,
they join
also unto our enemies, and
fight
against
us, and
so get (hem up out of the land."
Much proof points to the fact that the new pharaoh who
ascended
the
throne
was Ahmose
I
or Ahmese,
the
first
king of
the
brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty
(1580-1557
B.C.).
He
re-established
the government
at Thebes;
expelled
the
Hyksos, and instituted something like a
fascist form of gov-
ernment.
This
government
was
an
autocratic
nationalist
regime, exercising regimentation
of
industry,

Naturally, the Hebrews were not the only slaves in Egypt.
There were Ethiopian

Syrians
and people from the Aegean

were in the majority.

as the hornet, because he wore

Thutmose

Isis. His qualities of face were pure ink black, a broad nose
and

jointly with
his wife and
half-

IK.HNATON OR AMENHOTEP IV
Many years after the death of Thutmose
III, a new king
called
Amenhotep
IV became
a
religious
innovator. He
was not an excellent soldier or governor. He believed in one
god, the sun god Aten, who dominated
all
living creatures.
Because
he
was
excessively
preoccupied
with
religion,
he neglected
the kingdom. He ordered that
the temples of
the old Egyptian gods be closed, and he expelled the priest-

to
Ikh-

FORETELLING OF MOSES
One of the kings of the Eighteenth or Nineteenth Dynas-
ties was informed by his astrologer
(or sacred scribe) that a
child would be born
to the Hebrew nation.
If he were per-
mitted
to
live, he would bring the Egyptian kingdom
to a
low condition. The child was
born;
his name was
Moses.
He
was
reared
in
a
miraculous
way,
in
Pharaoh's own
palace by
his daughter. The
plot
to
destroy
Moses
in
his
infancy failed. The daughter of Pharaoh adopted Moses as
her son. She came
to her father and said,
"I have brought
up a child who
is of a divine form, and of a generous mind;
and
as
I have received him from
the bounty of
the
river,
in
a wonderful manner,
I thought
it proper
to adopt him
for my son, and
the
heir of thy kingdom." When she put
the child into Pharaoh's hand, he hugged the child and put
his diadem upon his head. lint Moses cast down the diadem
t

==================================================

=== CHUNK 114 ===
o the ground, and, in a childish mood, he twisted
it around
and stamped upon
it. The sacred scribe saw
all of
this
(he-
was the same astrologer who foretold that Moses' birth would
bring down
the Egyptian
Kingdom).
Because
of
this,
the
astrologer cried out
in a
terrifying manner, saying,
"This,
O King!
this child
is he of whom god foretold, that
if we kill
him we shall be in no danger; he himself affords an attesta-
tion
to the prediction of the same thing, by
this trampling
upon
thy
government,
and
treading
upon
thy
diadem."
The astrologer advocated
to have Moses executed in order
Black Civilization in Africa
67
to free (he Egyptians from fear and to deprive the Hebrews
of hope and freedom. At this intense moment, the daughter
of Pharaoh took
the child quietly. Because
the king loved
his daughter, he was not disposed to hurt her. When events
arrived
at
this
juncture,
the
Divine
Providence
protected
Moses, prevailing upon
the king
to spare him.
Moses was
educated,
as Josephus
says, and

==================================================

=== CHUNK 115 ===

it
is highly probable
that
he received the best education the ancient world could give.
We must remember
that
Egypt
possessed
institutions
of
higher learning and
that Pharaoh's palace and temple was
the chief center of
the educated
class.
Moses was exposed
to the best Egypt had to afford. Those who think Moses was
just
an
ignorant
religious
leader
are
quite
wrong.
Moses
knew
the
political,
social, and
natural
sciences
of
Egypt:
he learned the religious system, the political system, mathe-
matics, geometry, biology, chemistry, anatomy,
foreign
lan-
guages,
law, engineering, and
military
tactics.
Josephus writes the following: "Moses arrived at the age
of maturity and he displayed
his virtue and abilities
to the
Egyptians. The Egyptians interpreted Moses' actions as their
imminent doom and the elevation of the Hebrews."
During the course of Egyptian history, there were many
Wars with the Cushite kingdom of Ethiopia
(sometimes
this
region
is known
as Nubia). When
Moses had reached
the
ag

==================================================

=== CHUNK 116 ===
e of maturity, the Ethiopians were making incursions into
Egyptian
territory. The Egyptians were
in a state of bitter
distress
because
of
these
predatory
attacks.
Josephus
said
that they penetrated
as
far as the city of Minphis near the
Nile delta. Because of the urgency of the military situation,
the Egyptians made an inquiry through the oracles and the
prophecies. They were
told by their god
to secure
the
as-
sistance of Moses. Then Pharaoh commanded
his daughter
to bring Moses into his presence, but
first Pharaoh had
to
swear to his daughter that no misfortune would happen
to
him. Moses was brought into Pharaoh's presence, informed
of the deteriorating military situation, and given generalship
of the Egyptian army. The Egyptian
priests gave only
tacit

they were skeptical
of
his loyalty, and hoped that he would be killed in the ensuing
battles. The Hebrews
were
greatly
exuberant
because
of
the promotion of Moses. They ex

=== CHUNK 117 ===
pected Moses
lo

Moses marshaled
his army and marched southward. He
did not follow the Nile, but took the inland route, cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
Ethiopians would be most
vigilant
at
the
river.
But
the
land
route
presented
a
severe
danger.
It was inhabited with deadly serpents, which
this area pro-
duced
in mass numbers. Legend
says
that
these snakes
fly
in
the
air and descend on men unaware. For
that reason,
Moses devised an ingenious plan to combat these evil crea-
tures. He
filled
baskets
with
an
animal
called
Ibes and
transported
them
along
with
him.
These
Ibes
are
very
dangerous to the snake family;
they
fly after the snakes and
consume
them
completely. When
Moses
approached
the
land of the serpents, lie
let loose the Ibes, and they destroyed
the snakes.
Then
Moses came
upon
the
Ethiopians
secretly;
van-
(pished them
in
battle and demolished
their
cities. Those
that
escaped
retreated
to Saba
(Sheba),
their
capital.

to be
located
at
Napata
(at
the
fourth
cateract).
Later
it
was
moved
to Meroe. Moses found the city of Meroe well
forti-
fied.
It was surrounded by a high wall, and there was a river
around the wall
that made
it look
like an
island. The city
was constructed so strongly that when the water of the river
became violent,
it could not move the foundation of the city.
The city of Meroe was extremely difficult to subdue and the
army was lying
idle. Then the daughter20 of the Ethiopian
king happened to sec Moses as he led the army near the wall,
fighting with
great
gallantry. She
finally arranged
a
treaty
of peace with
Moses, agreeing
to surrender
the
city
if he

and

Dynasty,
probably
Ramses
I, or Seti
[. The Egyptians hated Moses even more
when they found out
that he was successful
in
battle. The
Egyptians became suspicious of Moses because they thought
he would
incite
a
slave
insurrection,
so
they conspired
to
assassinate him. When Moses learned of the conspiracy he
escaped
to the land of Midian.
RAMSES
II
Ramses II was the fourth king of the Nineteenth Dynasty
(1292-1225
B.C.) and
the son of Seti
I. He was pure
black,
had thick
lips and a broad nose like the people of the west-
ern Sudan today. He was a warlike pharaoh, industrious and
energetic,
ruling
Egypt
for
sixty-seven
years.
In
the
early
years
of
his reign, he engaged
in the important campaign
against
the
Hittites. At Kadesh, near
Syria,
the
battle was
indecisive. Finally, he signed a permanent peace treaty with
the king of the
Hittites, married
the king's daughter; and
the remaining years of
his
life were
relatively peaceful.
Ramses
II
is
also known
for
his
national
public work
projects.

==================================================

=== CHUNK 120 ===

Because
these
projects
required
the
forced
labor
of thousands of Hebrew slaves, he
is known as the Pharaoh
of the Oppression. He was
a
boastful,
vainglorious,
tyran-
nical personality who sought to astound humanity by cover-
ing
the country
with
megalithic
structures.
This Ramses
transferred
the
capital
to
the
Nile
delta. The
black Jews
constructed the treasure cities, Pithom and Ramses. Ramses
developed
the Nile delta and had
the slaves build
Egypt's
megaliths:
the colonnade
at Luxor and
its gigantic
pylon,
in front of which he placed
six colossal statues of himself.
Each of these statues was almost sixty feet
high. Ramses

erased
his
predecessors' names from

records and

Moses entered Egypt, probably during the reign of Ram-
ses
II or Mcrneptah. Me
(Moses) was commissioned by the
God of Israel
to go down Into Egypt and to
tell Pharaoh to
let
his people go.
Moses did
not have any
great
difficulty
entering the palace of Pharaoh; he had been reared
in
the
king's palace, and he knew Egyptian protoml. He decided
to enter the palace at the time that Pharaoh was entertaining
various ambassadors from foreign nations.
After Egypt was weakened and
terrified by
the scourge
of the ten
plagues, Pharaoh
agreed
to emancipate
the He-
brew slaves.
Beginning with

of Merneptah and
the

There were
revolts throughout

It
is evident
that the emancipation

trig-

these

CUSH
(ETHIOPIA)
The ancient country of Gush was in
the eastern Sudan
region of Africa. During
the Middle Ages,
the Sudan was
not
united and
organized
as
a
single country. The

Asian world considered

its

the
east,
its
longest part about 4000 miles. This vast area includes such
countries as the modern Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, Guinea,
Senegal, Gambia, Upper Volta, etcetra. During the colonial
period, this area was divided into two parts called the French
Sudan in the west and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the east.
The word Sudan
is an Arabic word meaning black. The
Arabs called
this vast area liilad es Sudan
(the
territory
of
the black) because the tribes here were very black, unmixed
tribes.
In dealing with the kingdom of Cush, we find that
it
is
located in the eastern Sudan near the Red Sea. The country
of Cush was situated on both sides of the Nile River between
the third and sixth cataracts. The modern nation called the
Sudan occupies
this
territory. The important
cities
of
an-
cient Cush were Napata, Meroe, Musawarat, Kurru, Kurgas,
and
Naga. There were
two
civilizations
of
the
Ethiopian
people in the continent of Africa: one was in the highlands
of
Ethiopia-' 2 with
its
capital
at

==================================================

 Axum;
the second was
lo-
cated in the region of the present day Sudan with
its capital
at Napata and at other times, at Meroe.
The people
in
the ancient country of Cush were called
Nuba or Nubians
as subnames;
other subnames
they
use
are Bcjas or
Iiisharin, which

it would be correct to say, are northern Ethiopians who

in

of calling

Negroes.
True Africans are indeed Africans regardless of what they

CUSHITE CONQUEST
When
tlie power of the Libyan
kings
of
Egypt
began
to wane in the eighth century, the northern Ethiopian king,
1'iankhi, marched from
his capital
of Napata and invaded
Egypt.
The Cushite kings of Napata and Meroe were sub-
servient
to
the
Egyptian crown
for over
1000
years. They


==================================================

paid tribute mostly
in
gold,
ivory,
slaves,
cattle, and
fight-
ing men. At
this time
the Ethiopians were bra/en enough
to
challenge
the
world's
greatest
empire.
I'iankhi's
elite
troops and
his mighty naval
forces attacked
city

until
they reached Memphis. Hermopolis
fell
before him.
Even the capital of Osorkon
III at Hcliopolis could not with-
stand
his advances.
The enemy
capitulated
at
the
capital,
and the supremacy of Ethiopia was established
in
Egypt.
Rogers
says
that
"1'iankhi

About
712
b.c.
there
arose
another
king
(Ethiopian)
over the city of Napata. This new king was called Shabaka
or
Sabacon,

==================================================

=== CHUNK 126 ===

the
brother
of
Piankhi. He
established
the
Twenty-fifth
(Ethiopian)
Dynasty
in
Egypt.
According
to
Manctho,
he burned
Hocchoris
alive,
the
alleged
ruler
of
the Twenty-fourth Dynasty.
During the long history of the Middle
East, there have
always been wars bctwen
the military powers north
of
the
land
of
Israel
(by way
of
Syria) and
the
military
powers
south of
Israel
(Egypt).

Both

other words,

the
Assyrians were threatening the existence of Judah. Taharka
captured
Philistia

the year 688 n.c, but was defeated
at
Eltckch, west of Jerusalem, by the Assyrians. Also Taharka
was
the
third
king
in
the
Twenty-fifth
Egyptian
Dynasty
(715-663). At
first, he defeated Esarhaddon, but
three years
later
(071) he was expelled from
the
city of Memphis and
never returned.
Ethiopia,
this African
state, became
a great power, even
though
it was only for a period of a hundred years.
If Assyria
had not emerged when she
did,
Ethiopia probably would
have lasted another hundred years as a western Mediterranean
power. Because the Ethiopians were defeated by the
Assyri-
ans, we must not cone hide that their existence and influence
was stifled or choked out. Indeed, Rogers says that Nastasen,
a
later
kiiij,' of
the
Ethiopians,
defeated
the
great

conqueror, Cambysis
in 525

in the same manner culture and civili-

continent
of Africa.
It seems
that
the Ctishite
civilization developed
in two
stages,
first at the famous city of Napata and second at
the

city
of Meroe. The

of Napata

is an excellent
description of the abundance of gold in Ethiopia: "Cambyses

the

curiosity
of
the
Persians, with
its elephants and ivory and

Kashta
was
one
of

of

he
began
the
conquest
of
Egypt which
his
son
Piankhi continued. The
city of Napata was
located
inside
the river bend between the third and fourth
cataracts.
History
is witness
to
the
fact
that
the greatest
civiliza-
tions developed alongside
river banks and
so
it
was
with
the Ethiopian
cities of Napata and Meroe.
Meroe was a greater city than Napata.
It was located be-
tween
the
fifth and
sixth
cataracts and
between
the
Nile
and the Atbara rivers. Meroe
is a very ancient
city. As you
have read, Moses, the Hebrew, led an Egyptian army against
it about
1350
B.C. Obviously,
it was standing when Thut-
mosis
I
(1510-1501)
established
his
southern
frontier
in
Ethiopian
territory. This
frontier was
located
past Napata
almost to the
fifth cataract. Between 595 and 550 the capital
of Gush was transferred from Napata to Meroe; the primary
motive for
this
transference was because
of the Persian

one,

two,
there were

RETENTION OF CUSHITE IDENTITY
Although
the
Egyptians
dominated
parts
of
Ethiopia
for over a thousand years, the Ethiopians, to a great extent,
maintained
their own
identity,
ideas,
and
customs. The
Cushites were never absorbed
(nationally) into the Egyptian
social structure.
It has been postulated by some authorities
th

(Ethiopian) Dynasty
accepted
Egyptian
gods;
nevertheless,
these
kings were
in-
terred in their tombs in a position that accorded with
Ethi-
opian
tradition,
but
not
according
to
Egyptian
customs.
After
the year 500
b.c.
there emerged
a more
distinctive
Cushite
culture,
similar
to a
"Cushite
Renaissance."
The
gods arc the gods of Meroe, not Egypt. The stone ram, sym-
bolic
of
the power
of
the god
Amiin,
stood
outside
the
temple of Naga, a Cushite city. The Meroites employed the
Egyptian
hieroglyphic
writing
in
their
temple,
but
after
225
n.c. they devised their own alphabet even before Rome
became
a great power. They began
to create
fine
pottery
with
their own
original
styles.
Also
they constructed ma-
jestic temples and palaces of beautiful design. Many of the
ruins of ancient Cush are still standing at Meroe, Musawarat,
Naga, and near Napata.
Basil Davidson

these
sites are
waiting
for more

Th

e
Cushites
built
a
powerful
empire
in
Africa
that
extended
far and wide. Their
political and
military sway
extended
to the Red Sea,
to
the Axumite kingdom
to
the
south.
Evidence
has been found
that
Ethiopian
influence
extended
to Lake Chad and to the Uganda
territory. There
was
even
trade
with
Arabia,
India,
China,
Egypt, Axum,
and the neighboring tribes.
Cush
was no
playboy on
the
international
stage,
but
was
recognized and known among
the
greatest
powers
of
the
day. The
Ethiopians
fought
successive
wars
with
the
Egyptians,
Hebrews,
Assyrians,
Persians,
and
under
the
76
From Babylon to Timbuktu

they
fought
the Arabians. Cush was
a
sophisticated power and during
her
greatness
she became
the mistress of the south. The greatness of Ethiopia
is writ-
ten in the annals of the ancient nations; she dispatched her
ambassadors
to
the known
nations of her day.
Herodotus,
the
Greek
historian,
knew
little
about
the
Ethiopians.
Furthermore, he did
not
visit
this
intriguing
land. Wh

=== CHUNK 133 ===
en
Herodotus heard of this land, he called the people Aithiops;
in the Greek language this word means burnt face. He never
called them by their national name, which
is Cush.
Finally, the civilization in the highlands of ancient Ethi-
opia at Axum began to rise. King Ezana of Axum marched
down
to the city of Meroe and attacked
it, putting an end
to
its greatness. The causes of the wars between Meroe and
Axum probably were
trade competition and
the
influx
of
Nubians from the Sahara.25
THE BLACK AFRICAN HEBREWS OF
EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA
From what period can we certify the existence of black
Hebrews in Egypt and Ethiopia?
It
is certain
that
Israelites
were
in
Egypt
and
Ethiopia
during
the
period
of
King
Takelot of Egypt
(Twenty-third Tanite Dynasty about 725
B.c.j and the prophet Isaiah of Jerusalem;
because we read
in Isaiah
11:11
that: "And
it shall come to pass in that day,
that
the
I.ord shall
set
his hand
again
the second
time
to
recover the remnant of his people, which shall be
left, fro

==================================================

=== CHUNK 134 ===
m
Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros [Upper Egypt],
and from Cush [Ethiopia]
.
.
." In Isaiah 27:13, we get the
understanding
that
the
outcasts
of Judali
are
in
the
land
of Egypt;
in
19:18
the prophet
is
positive
that
five
cities
(with Jews and
Egyptian
converts)
will accept
the God of
Israel and
will
speak
the
language
of Canaan
(Hebrew).
About
seventy
years
after
Isaiah,
the
Prophet
Zephaniah
(3:10) says "From beyond
the
river of Ethiopia my suppli-
ants, even
the daughter of my
dispersed,
shall
bring mine
Black Civilization in Africa
77
offering." Many authorities have agreed that Zephaniah was
speaking concerning the Jews who were dispersed and who
colonized the region
in and around
Ethiopia.
Since
the Hebrew prophets and
historians,
for example
Josephus, knew
that Jews were
in Egypt and Ethiopia,
the
next question
is—what are some of the
theories concerning
their arrival
in these countries? The theories are as follows:
King Solomon
married
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
Egypt.

==================================================

=== CHUNK 135 ===

Obviously,
this
marriage
was
for
economical
and
political
reasons
(I
Kings
11:1). Solomon wanted
to main-
tain international peace, security, and commerce.
It
is prob-
able
that he arranged
with
Pharaoh,
his
father-in-law,
to
establish Jewish
trade colonies on
the
Nile
River.
By
the
way, Solomon married the daughters of many kings to keep
them under his economic and political control.
In
I Kings 9:26 we read that "King Solomon made a navy
of ships in Ezion-geber28 which
is beside Elotli, on the shore
of the Red Sea in the Land of Edom. And Hiram [the King
of Tyre or Phoenicia] sent in the navy his servants, shipmen
that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
"And
they came
to Ophir and
fetched from
thence
gold,
four hundred and
twenty
talents, and brought
it
to King
Solomon." Many scholars have
postulated
that
the land of
Ophir
is on the east coast of Africa,
this would be
in Ethi-
opia territory.27
It would appear highly probable that Solo-
mon would establish trade 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 136 ===
colonies along the east and west
coasts of the Red Sea. Ancient
Ethiopia had excessive gold
deposits
to
satisfy Solomon's need. As has been mentioned
previously, the Persian troops of Cambyses said, "the prison-
ers in Ethiopia wore fetters of gold."
The Queen of Sheba visited Solomon: The fact
that her
visit
occurs
after
the voyage of Solomon-Hiram's navy
to
Ophir suggests
that,
in
the mind
of the
writer, Ophir was
associated with
the
territory of
that rich Queen
of Sheba.
Apparently, when
the navy of Solomon came
to Ophir,
the Queen of Sheba heard about
the greatness of Solomon.
Josephus, 28 the Jewish
historian,
certified
the
fact
that
the
78
From Babylon to Timbuktu
Queen
of Sheba was
the Queen
of Egypt 20 and
Ethiopia.
This would mean that Jewish trade colonies were established
in her territory. Josephus also says that the royal city of the
Ethiopians was Saba 30
(or Sheba— the two words are
inter-
changeable).
According to the Ethiopians and
the black Jews of
this
country,
the Qu

==================================================

=== CHUNK 137 ===
een of Sheba gave birth
to a son of whom
they
say Solomon was
the
father;
moreover,
they
say
that
other black Jews accompanied
the Queen back
to Ethiopia.
The name of the child to whom she gave birth was Menilek.
Years
later,
as
the
story
is
related,
Menilek
returned
to
Jerusalem for his education. On his return
trip to Ethiopia.
Solomon
sent
along
with
him
some
leading
priests
and
officers. 31 All of these events occurred during the tenth cen-
tury b.c. This was probably the first organized Jewish colony
in Ethiopia.
In
this same century,
Sheshak,
the King
of
Egypt,
in-
vaded
Palestine
(I
Kings
14:25). Without doubt, he must
have transported many Jews to Egypt and Ethiopia because
he
look
prisoners
with
him,
and
his army
consisted
of
Libyans and Ethiopians. 32 During the late part of the eighth
or the early part of the seventh century, the Ethiopian gen-
eral Tirhaka invaded
Palestine and captured more than
a
few towns. The prophet Isaiah certainly knew what he was
talking
about when


==================================================

=== CHUNK 138 ===
he
spoke
of
the
Israelites'
exiles
in
Tirhakah's country
at
that
time. Even
the advance of
the
mighty
Assyrian
army
woidd
motivate many
Israelites
to
take refuge
in
I'-gypt, Libya, and
Ethiopia.
Again,
the
in-
cursions of
the powerful army
of King Nebuchadrezzar
of
Babylon
(in
the
years 608-675)
into
Palestine undoubtedly
caused
rapid and numerous
migratory
waves
of
Israelites
to
flee
into north and
east
Africa.
In Jeremiah
44:1,
the
Prophet addresses the Jews
in Egypt and the Jews
that
live
in Pathros, which
is southern Egypt. Jeremiah
tells the Jews
(in the eleventh verse) that they are not safe from Nebuchad-
rezzar. This warning would naturally
influence many Jews
to migrate deeper
into
Ethiopia and
the Sahara
Desert.
Black Civilization in Africa
79
By the time of the Prophet Zephaniah
(about 630
B.C.).
Ethiopia and the adjacent lands of Uganda and Kenya were
swarming with black Jews. Zephaniah says
(3:10: "From be-
yond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter
of my

==================================================

=== CHUNK 139 ===
 dispersed shall bring mine offering." This verse
is an
indication that the Israelites would be multiplying and mak-
ing
converts among
the
inhabitants beyond
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia. No doubt
this prophet had communication with
the Jews in
this remote area.
The
"rivers of
Ethiopia" connect
with
the Nile water
system
in the heart
of Ethiopia:
the Atbara River extends
from
the highlands
of modern
Ethiopia
to
the
Nile;
the
Blue Nile
extends, from
the
direction
of Addis Ababa
in
a northwestern direction toward the Nile. Near Uganda and
the northern Congo
is the Babr
el Gha/al
River.
It
is 500
miles
long,
in southwest Sudan; formed by
the confluence
of the Bahr el Arab and Jur rivers in northwest Upper Nile;
it flows east
to unite at Late No with the Bahr el Jebcl and
form the White Nile. These areas are "beyond the rivers of
Ethiopia"; moreover, arc there any records or oral traditions
of the existence of
Jewish tribes deeply "beyond
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia"? Joseph
J. Williams"
cites

ticular
case.
He said, "There can be
little doubt but that somewhere in
the dim past, probably by way of Abyssinia, a wave of Hebraic
culture penetrated
to
the Lake
District
of
east
Africa,"
if
we may credit
the following citations:
Speaking of Uganda
to
the
west
of Lake
Victoria and
northeast of the Belgian Congo;
"It has an organized native
government,
with
a
tradition
of

a

to King David.
It
is a proud
history. The legends
tell of the Uganda people crossmg the
Nile
[rememher, beyond
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia] cnturics
upon centuries ago, and subduing
all
tribes whose country
they traversed. They claim the highest native civilization
in
Africa."
The above
report
is
highly
credible
in
all
its
details,
if we keep
in mind what
I have written pertaining
to the
30
From Babylon to Timbuktu
Egyptian and Cushite Jews. The thing that might be ques-
tioned about
the Uganda people
is not
their
identity, but
the vitality of the Jewishness of the

==================================================

=== CHUNK 141 ===
ir religion.
TABIBAN KAMANT AND WASAMBARA JEWS
Professor Allen
S. Godbey 81 says that the word Tabiban
means smiths; he has located these Jews in central
Ethiopia.
The Tabiban Jews were really Falashas, but they were forced
to accept a nominal
Christianity. They were
like the Mar-
rano Jews of Spain, forced to accept a religion against their
will. The word
Falasha
in Amharic,
the
official
language
of
Ethiopia, means immigrants. The
Falashas did not
call
themselves by
this name;
they used
the name "Bet
Israel"
(the house of Israel), but the Abyssians called them
Falashas.
Because
the
other
tribes
in
Ethiopia
called
the
house
of
Israel
Falashas or immigrants,
this would suggest
that
per
haps
the
Falasha Jews came
to Abyssinia
at
a
later
date;
therefore, they were ostracized because they did not accept
Christianity.
The
Falashas held
the monopoly on
the
skilled
trades
in Ethiopia:
they were leather-workers,
potters, smiths, and
masons.
The Kamant Jews were separated
into two
classes:
the


==================================================

=== CHUNK 142 ===
Keberti
(honored), from
these
the
priests
are chosen, and
the
Yetanti
(small
or
insignificant
people).
By
the
way,
these two classes were called by names
that are similar
to
the
Hebrew. The Kamant Jews esteem
Moses highly and
many other Old Testament personalities; they observe Yom
Kippur and
the
feasts
for
the dead.
Because
they remain
isolated from other Jews, Christian, and pagans,
they learn
very
little from the external world.
About
thirteen hundred miles south
of the
territory
of
the Falashas
live the Wasambara people. They are a variety
of colors from light brown to black. In their land are found
asylum
institutions
(cities
of
refuge),85
they
are
like
the
Levitical cities found in the Old Testament. Professor God-
Black Civilization in Africa
81
bey
says, "Taken with
sacrifices,
wherever Judaism
is
ac-
knowledged, there must have been introduced by Yemenite
or Himyaritic Jewish
traders
in very ancient times."
Concerning the Wasanibara people along the
east coast
of Africa opposi

==================================================

=== CHUNK 143 ===
te the Island of Zanzibar we know very little.
But
it
is a known fact among scholars that Jewish merchants
from Yemen
traded
along
that
coast.
It
is
possible
that
Jewish
colonics
were
established
there
at
an
early
date.
It
is also a probability that Jewish
tribes migrated from the
north.
I
have
shown
previously
that
Jewish
immigrants
crossed
the Red Sea
into
Ethiopia and
that Jewish immi-
grants migrated from Egypt
to
Ethiopia. My conclusion
is
this:
the nation
of Ethiopia became a confluence or
cross-
road of a wave of Hebrew culture and settlements. Here
in
Ethiopia was
the great center of
the black Jews;
they
ex-
changed
ideas, some
settled down
to
stay,
others
departed
to the west and south.
Joseph
I.. Williams 3" quoting Walter Chicele Plowden,
the British Consul
in Abyssinia, agrees with my conclusion.
After the British Consul reviewed the National records and
traditions he concluded: "Two
things
are
certain— that
at
a
far
later
period,
six sovereigns of pure Jewish
race and
fait

==================================================

=== CHUNK 144 ===
h
reigned
at
Gondar, and
that
to
this day numerous
Jews are found throughout Abyssinia.
I think
it also highly
probable
that
(at
whatever
epoch
it may
be
placed)
the
whole
of Abyssinia
was
of Jewish
persuasion
previous
to
its conversion; as even those who have adopted the Christian
creed
still maintain
.
.
. numerous forms and observances."
As we can conclude from
the above and other records,
the
Christians
of
Abyssinia
were
once
Jews.
Incidentally,
Solomon
Grazel,
in
his book A
History
of
the Jews,
has
stated
that
there
still
exist
100,000 black Jews
in
Ethiopia
who arc not Christians.
After King Abraha of Ethiopia accepted Christianity in
the fourth
century,
a.d.,
a
great change occurred
that was
disastrous to the existence of the Jews: they became victims
of persecution
that lasted for many centuries. Ever since the
82
From Babylon to Timbuktu
rise of Christianity
in Ethiopia, Judaism
has been decreas-
ing.
Yet
in
spite
of
social
pressures
and
discrimination
100,000 black Jews have 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 145 ===
been able to survve. This multitude
of
Jews,
surviving
under
hostile
conditions,
proves
their
greater numerical
strength
earlier
in
their
history.
THE JEWS OF THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC
There
is an island near the southeastern coast of Africa
called the Malagasy Republic;
the old name for
this island
was Madacascar. Near the eastern
part of
this island on

Professor Allen

that
the same alphabetic

Moreover, he
says, since

of

this
indicates
the historical connection with the Jews of Madagascar. Like

THE NORTH AFRICAN BLACK JEWS
In
the year 331,
that Alexander the Great defeated
the
Persian emperor, Darius
at
the
Battle
of Gaugamela
(in-
correctly called Arbcla) a new master emerged on the world
stage and transformed the history and culture of three con-
tinents. However, Alexander died
in
the prime of his
life
at the age
of
thirty-two because of debauchery and
intoxi-
cation.
Before
the
death
of
Alexander,
his
desire
was
to
establish a Eurasi

an
state. His scheme was
to amalgamate"
the Greeks with
the Asians. This was implemented by
the
widespread marriage of his troops with
the colored women
of the
east. Most of
his troops remained
in the subjugated
countries and became absorbed into the native population.
After the death of Alexander, his vast empire was divided
among
his generals. Ptolemy
received
Egypt and
Seleucus
received
Asia. As time elapsed,
there was constant war
be-
tween these two dynasties. By the year 198
B.C., the descend-
ants
of
General
Seleucus had
their
capital
in
Syria,
just
north
of
Palestine,
In
this same year
the Seleucid Dynasty
in Syria compelled Egypt
to give up
Palestine,
the land
of
the Jews. The king of Syria at
this time was Antiochus
III.
When Antiochus IV usurped the throne in Syria (175-163
B.c._),
he
entertained
the
thought
of
uniting
Alexander's
empire. This meant
the conquest of
Egypt. However,
the
province that bordered on Egypt was Palestine, which stood
in
his way. At
this time,

ws would not accept Greek
culture,
nevertheless,
Antiochus
was
determined
to
Hel-
lenic
the Jews.
The army of Antiochus marched
into Palestine
to
sup-
port
Mcnelaus,
the
leader
of
the
pro-Syrian
party,
As
a
result, many Jews were
killed;
others
escaped
to
the
hills
and
to
Egypt. Only
those Jews
that supported
Antiochus'
policies remained
in Jerusalem. An edict was promulgated
interdicting the observance of the holidays, the Sabbath, and
circumcision. A statue of Jupiter was erected
in
the Holy
84
From Babylon to Timbuktu
Temple above the
aliar. To
this statue the people brought
the sacrifices of pig meat,
the animal which
is an abomina-
tion
to the Jews.
Because of
this religious persecution,
the
legitimate high priest
(Onias
III) and many other Jews
fled
into
African
countries
such
as
Egypt,
Ethiopia,
and
Cy-
renaica
(Libya). Throughout
the
last
twenty-five hundred
years,
the main
factors
that have contributed
to the
social
migration of the Jews were wars, religious persecution, and
c

ommerce, All these factors were operating and gave
rise to
the African Jewish population.
In
the
year G5
n.c.
the Roman
armies under General
Pompey captured Jerusalem.
In
70
a.d. General
Vespasian
and his son, Titus put an end to the Jewish state, with great
slaughter. During
the period of
the
military
governors
of
Palestine,
many
outrages
and
atrocities
were
committed
against
the residue of the
people. During the period from
Pompey to
Julius,
it has been estimated
that over 1,000,000
Jews
fled
into Africa,
fleeing from Roman persecution and
slavery. The slave markets were
full
of black Jewish slaves.
And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the
one end of the earth even unto the other; and
there

shah serve other gods, which

rted
the Jews into slavery, and
the sons of
Israel
transmigrated
to every continent.
The Jewish
philosopher,
Philo
(about
40
b.c-40
a.d.).
who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, said that one million Jews
resided
in
Libya and Kgypt from
the Catabathmos
to
the
borders of Ethiopia. Professor A. H. Godbey says that Philo
leaves
us doubtful about which boundaries of Ethiopia he
meant.
I think
that
Philo meant the western and southern
boundaries
of
Ethiopia,
hecause
the
prophet,
Zephaniah
mentioned: "From beyond
the
rivers
of

daughters of my dispersed." There was a period of over six
hundred years between Zephaniah and Philo; and consider-
ing the new waves of immigrants coming into Africa, they
had six hundred years
to penetrate toward
all
the borders
of Ethiopia. E. Schurcr wrote that Hebrewism was detectable
by
its inscriptions from the Egyptian border westward across
North
Africa
to
Mauretania.
A. H. Godbey88
says Jerome
(310-120 a.u., one of th

==================================================

=== CHUNK 151 ===
e four Doctors of the Church) wrote
that
the Jews were spread from
the western
extremity
of
Mauretania
to
India.
Now,
ancient
Mauretania
included
part of
the
territory on
the Atlantic Ocean, Morocco, and
part
of modern
Algeria.
It
is
certain
that
the Jews
had
migrated
all
across
North
Africa
by
the
second
century.
Some scholars fix the date earlier than
this.
The Greek
historian and
geographer,
Strabo
(63
b.c-
24 a.d.) said, concerning the Jews of Gyrene
(Libya): "Now
these Jews already have gotten
into all cities, and
it
is hard
to find a place in
the habitable earth
that has not admitted
this tribe of men and
is not possessed by
it; and
it has come
to pass that Egypt and Cyrene, as having the same governors,
and
a great many other nations imitate
their way of living,
mantain
great
bodies
of
these Jews
in
a
peculiar manner

the baptism of all the Jews in his domain, under the penalty
of expulsion and the loss of all their property. According to
Catholic authorities, ninety thousand embraced Christianity
at this time. This was forced baptism. In the seventh century
the Jews were threatened with the penalty of slavery

The Byzantine emperors, in the fifth and sixth centuries,

THE BLACK JEWISH EMPIRE OF GHANA
The ancient black empire of Ghana was established
in
the western Sudan. During the colonial period, the western
Sudan was called French West Africa:
the northern bound-

is the Sahara Desert; the western and south-
ern border
is Lake Chad. Some rivers of this region are the

in
Nigeria.
In ancient
times,
the
Carthaginians from north
Africa
penetrated the Sahara Desert and
the western Sudan during
the second and third centuries b.c. When north and eastern
Africa had amassed over a million Jews, these Jews began
a
continuous
migration
to
the
region
of
the
Niger
River.
According to the researches of Nahum Slouschz: "The
tradi-
tion
of
the Jewish
traders
in
the Sahara stretches back
to
biblical
times."*8 Slouschz continues: "And
it
is not
at
all
surprising
to encounter
in every part of the desert traces—
and even
survivals—of
a
primitive Judaism
which
at one
time played an important role
in
the whole region
of
the
Sahara from Senegal
to
the very borders
of Somaliland." 14
As
I have mentioned earlier,
this region that extends across
the
entire width
of
Africa, below
the Sahara
Desert from
Senegal to Somali land,
is known as the Sudan or black Africa.
Between
the second and

third centuries,

Ethiopia. The
largest exodus
of
the Jews occurred during
the persecution by
the Arabs
led by Mohammed. He had
said on
his dying bed
that he wanted Islam
to be supreme
throughout
all of Arabia.
There was a Jewish
tribe
called Rechab which
crossed
the Red Sea and migrated to the extreme point of the western
Sudan. 48
At the same time that the Jews were migrating westward
across the Sudan from
Ethiopia,
they
also migrated

to

they

in
west
Africa, where men could exchange their culture,
ideas, and
merchandise. These Jewish
migrations went on

Africa. He
writes
that
the Jews migrated up
the
Nile
passing
Memphis,
Elephantine,"
Khartum,
and
then they turned west at Kordofan in central Sudan.
In the
region of the White Nile, Williams thinks some Jews settled
in
the country of
the Shilluk,
in
the southern Sudan and
Uganda. He continues by tracing the migration from Kordo-
fan
(going west)
to Darfur, Lake Chad, Kano and then
to
the countries of the Niger River.
The original habitation of the Songhay people was Goun-
guia, Koukya, or Kuka. This place was situated in the Dendi
country and known
as Dendina, lying near the Niger River
on the northwestern border of what is now the modern state
of
Nigeria. Many
scholars
think
that
the Songhay
people
came
from
Kgypt
or
Ethiopia,
because
there
exist many
Egyptian culture complexes among them;
for example, the
preparation of the dead body
for

r the Dia Dynasty. This founder of
the first Sudanic Dynasty in western Africa was a black Jew; 48
his name
is sometimes written
Za-al Ayaman. Joseph
J. Wil-
liams says that
a citizen of Timbuktu named Abderrahman
Es-Sadi wrote
(1652)
in
his book Tarika es Sudan (History
of the Sudan) that Za-al-Ayaman was derived from dza mill
el-Yemen,
which
means,
he
is come
from
Yemen.
Za
el
Yemeni came
to
the Niger country by way
of Wargla
in
central
Algeria; Wargla was a great
trading center
of
the
black
Jews. Dr. Barth and Professor Godbey say that Za, the
founder of the
First Jewish Dynasty, established
his capital
later at Gao, on the eastern Upper Niger River.
The Arabs, Moors, and the Sudanic writers attribute
to
the ancient black African Hebrews the establishment of the
first
empires, "the erection of
the
first
public buildings

the country,
the construction
of the

By what
factors can we explain
the emergence of black
Hebrew hegemony and leadership over the indigenous tribes?
The
answer
is
simple: The Jews came
into
the
western
Sudan
from northern and
eastern
Africa
as
a
result
of
a
chain of commercial and persecutory migrations. The Jews
had settled among the most civilized people throughout the
ages. They adopted new methods from other people and
left
their material,
educational, and moral
imprint among
the
people
with whom
they
resided. For many
centuries
the
Hebrews had
to employ
great
physical
and
psychological
initiative. They could not afford
to be complacent or apa-
thetic; they were hated, so apathy could mean cultural
stag-
nation or death. The Jews imported
into
the western
part
of Africa
a superior material,
educational, and moral
cul-
ture soon after 300
a.i>., and this cultural advancement was
not duplicated or exceeded until the ascendancy of the Mo
hammedan leader Mansa Kankan Musa of Mal

==================================================

=== CHUNK 162 ===
i in 1312 a.d.
In
the third and fourth centuries
A.n.,
the Africans on
the
west
coast did
not
possess
the
cultural
superiority
of
the
Africans on the north and east coasts.
The black Jews had an advantage over the African tribes:
they carried their culture, history, laws, and written records
with them;
this assured them
a constant precedent
for the
development of a higher social organization. Because of
the
stability of the black Jewish culture, the Jews were not ab-
sorbed into the autochthonous population. In
fact, the Jews
absorbed some of the native
tribes. The Jews made use of
every
opportunity;
they
were
an
industrious and
skillful
people:
In

kings,

iculturists,

The black Hebrew kings
of Ghana had two
titles:
(I)
Black Civilization in Africa
91
Kayamaga
(master
of
gold);
(2) and Ghana
(war
chief).
Professor C.odbey says that twenty-two Hebrew kings reigned
in G liana before the Hegira
in G22
A.D., and forty-four had
reigned by 790. 50 Davidson makes mention of the Tarikh
el
Fetlach (History of the Researcher) which says that Kumbi
had been
the capital of the vast country of the Kayamaga,
while
the Tarikh es Sudan
states
that Kayamaga had been
the name of the first king of this country. It
is apparent that
all
the kings of Ghana were called by
the
title Kayamaga.
And concerning Kumbi, the ancient capital of Ghana,
it was
located in the southern part of the present country of Mali.
During the Middle Ages the name Ghana was not used
to
designate the country; the name of this country was Aoukar,
and Ghana was just the title of
its kings. Having cognizance

cause after the decline of the Za Dynasty men began
to call this country after the title of its kings, which
is Ghana,
and
I shall do the same.
In
the fourteenth century
a Muslim writer named Ibn
Batuta wrote about the women in one of the cities of Ghana.
He found the women of Walata
of surpassing beauty, and
he should have known what he was
talking about because
he had
traveled
widely.
Moreover,
he
found another
fact
astounding: The women were given more respect than
the
men,
and
the
males
did
not
express
any
resentment
or
jealousy. The people did not trace their descent from a pa-
ternal head but from their maternal brother. An individual
bequeathed his legacy to his sister's sons.
The material foundation of the Ghanaian state was based
on the affluence of gold and iron. The use of iron in Africa,
especially Ghana, revolutionized the social and military sys-
tems.
F.I Zouhri stated that the Ghanaians fought many wars
against
their neighbors, who did not
use
iron, but

 of ebony. The Ghanaians could destroy their ene-
mies because they fought with lances and swords. The king's
revenue agents levied taxes on imports and exports and the
medium of exchange was gold.

From Babylon

writes: "Whatever may be thought of the more or less mytho-
logical
traditions connected with
the earliest Jews in North
Africa,
it
is now practically an established fact that a Jewish
nation—Jewish at
least in faith, and perhaps too in origin-
long held sway south of the Sahara." 51
ELDAD THE DANITE
In the ninth century a black African Hebrew arrived in
the city of Kaironan
in Algeria.
In
this city was one of the
famous Talmudic
schools. The name
of
this Hebrew was
Eldad the Danite. He told a credible story of a Hebrew em-
pire south
of
the Sahara
in
the western Sudan. According
to Eldad the Danite, the Hebrews
in the interior of Africa
spoke
a
Phoenician-Hebraic
language mixed
with
Arabic.
They had a religion which

==================================================

=== CHUNK 166 ===
 had come down from Moses and
a Hebrew emperor.
It was believed
that
this emperor was
named Tloutan or Boulatan. Eldad said
that
the people of
this tribe had fled from the kingdom of Israel after Sennach-
erib,
the Assyrian, had subdued
it, and
that other
Israelite
tribes such
as Naphtali, Gad, and Ashcr were
in
the land
from which he came. He
told of
the laws of Moses which
they followed,
the complete
series
of
the Scriptures except
Esther and
Lamentations. He
did
not
speak
of
the
legal
works
that
were produced
in
Babylon and
Palestine
after
the destruction of the
First Temple of which
the Algerian
Jews had a knowledge. These extraordinary works were the
Mishnn and the Talmud. Eldad displayed as evidence some
ceremony pertaining to the slaughtering of animals for food;
it was written
in Hebrew with an Arabic
tinge but Eldad
claimed that
he knew no other language than Hebrew.
In
regard to Eldad's story, the Gaon
(head of the Jews) assured
the people that the story was credible.02

fact
that Ghana was

I shall continue my writ-

His name was

==================================================

=== CHUNK 168 ===
p to
this time
all
the kings of Ghana pro-
fessed
the Hebrew religion; however,
in
this year a radical
transformation occurred: Za Kasi accepted Islam. Davidson,
quoting
t he Tarikh el Feltach, says that the King of Songhay
(Ghana) was persuaded to convert to Islam by the merchants
of
the
city of Gao, who already had become wealthy and
economically
powerful. Much
of Ghana's
trade was main-
tained with
the Muslims of the
north. The north Africans
were ardent Mohammedans in their day; and economics and
religion were co-partners, operating concertedly
in
the city
of Gao.
I do
not condemn Za
Kasi
for
his conversion
to
Islam;
in
fact
I shall justify
his actions. The Muslims were
dominating Ghana's
vital
trade
links
in North
Africa and
the Sahara and
it was good for Ghana's security to be recog-
nizee! as having a Mohammedan king.
Concerning Islam in the western Sudan, Basil Davidson 58
makes the following observation: "Islam reaches the markets

least

tury. But
it
makes
little
initial
impact. The
rulers
of Ghana do
not
accept
Islam as one of their state religions. Only at the be-
ginning of the eleventh century are
there a few such con-
versions, the earliest
of any importance of which we know
being
that
of
the king
of Gao,
traditionally
in
1010,
fol-
lowed by that of the king of Kanem-Bornu in
1086." David-

From Babylon

son
says:
"These
arc
tactical
conversions
(these kings
are
Moslems only in name), motivated as much hy commercial
convenience as by appreciation of the political and religious
achievements and teaching of Islam."
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
kings of Ghana
professed
Islam, many
of
the
inhabitants remained
Jews.
El
Bekri,
the Moslem writer, wrote about Ghana in 1067. The King of
Ghana, in his day, was Tenkamenin, who came to the throne
a.d.
1062.
El
Rekri
says
that
the King
of Ghana, Tenka-
menin, was the ruler of a great empire and he was able
to
organize an army of two hundred thousand men. *
In
the

==================================================

=== CHUNK 170 ===
 eleventh
century
a Mohammedan
people
from
the northwest invaded
the
city
of Aoudaghast
within
the
Empire of Ghana. These invaders were called
the Almora-
vides. By
the year
1076
a.d. Abu
Bakr,
the
leader
of
the
Almoravides, captured
the capital
of Ghana; however,
the
Islamic-Jewish
king was
allowed
to
maintain
his
throne;
Tenkamenin paid tribute
to Abu
Bakr.
At
this time Gao or Gagho,
the
capital
of Ghana, was
separated
into two
cities;
the
first one was
the
residence
of the king. This city contained a
fortress which was
sur-
rounded
by
a
wall. The
second
city
contained
twelve
mosques in which the Mohammedan merchants could settle
or wait until they transacted their business. This description
given by El Bekri leaves us with the impression that the city
of
the
king's residence was probably
inhabited mainly by
Jews, because there was a great distinction between the king's
residence and the residence of the Mohammedans.
In

Ahmed Baba, a native of Songhay,

identical with

the third succeeding

THE EMPIRE OF MALI
The empire of Mali
is also called the Mellestinc empire.
The word
Mali
is derived from
a Mandingo grammatical
root meaning
free. The rulers and people of the empire of
Mali were black Africans of the Mandingo
tribe. This tribe
was
originally
situated
in
the
territory known
today
as
Guinea Sierra Leone and northward. On
the banks
of
the
Upper Niger near the
present-day
Sierra Leone,
the Man-
dingos established their capital
at a place called Niani.
After
the break-up of
the Ghanaian
Em

==================================================

=== CHUNK 172 ===
pire
by
inva-
sions from many
tribes, Ghana split apart into a number of
states. Rut
in
the
capital
of Ghana, Gao,
the Hebrew
Za
kings continued
to reign.
Many
people who
were
subject
to Ghana
proclaimed
their independence after chaos set
in. The most celebrated
of
these
people were
the Mandingos who
established
the
nucleus of a new empire about the middle of the thirteenth
century
(1240 a.d.).
There are
several important
factors
that we must
con-
sider in order
to comprehend the
rise of Mali.
First of
all,
Mali had received an impetus and significant influence from
her predecessor Ghana
to the north. This influence can be
explained
in
political, economic, and
religious
ways. The
Muslim merchants of the
north and
the Sahara had
their
trading centers in the cities of Ghana. The Mandingo trad-
ers of Mali traded with
the Muslims.
In
those days, and to
some extent
today, commerce and
religion have
operated
together. The Mandingo merchants recognized
the
advan-
tages of the rapidly growing

==================================================

=== CHUNK 173 ===
 powerful influential culture and
religion of the Muslims in the north. As a result, the Man-
dingo merchants played
a great
part
in
the
transportation
of Islam to their people.
The Mandingos were
a
successful
agricultural
people.
They were blessed with the availability of rivers which they
used for irrigation. They grew rice and other staples which
contributed
to a
rapidly growing
population. The
people
96
From Babylon to Timbuktu
of Mali had enough grain
lo sell
to the people of the Sahara
and
the
north. They developed market-towns which
later
grew into cities and states. With their trading abilities, their
skills and vigorous energy, Davidson
said,
the
Mandingos
became
"rich." Davidson continued: "With
the collapse of
Ghana
(as an empire), their chance of large political power
was open. They grasped
it with a sure hand."
In dealing with the kings of Mali, Ibn Khaldun
is rated
as our best authority. He wrote about
1376
a.d.
The King of Mali who
is rendered credit for the estab-
lishm

==================================================

=== CHUNK 174 ===
ent and organization of an imperial system in Mali was
Sundiata. The
year
that
the Mandingo
state
rose
to
im-
perial power
is dated from
1240.
In
this
year
a
decisive
battle was fought between the Mandingos and a people from
Tekrur, evidently Almoravidcs from medieval
Mauretania.
Sundiata defeated Sumanguru and his people, who had cap-
tured the seat of the Hebrew kings of Ghana and imposed
a tribute on them. Like other kings of the western Sudan,
Sundiata knew
that power was contingent on
wealih; most
of the wealth was in trade; and most of the trade was in the
hands of Muslims; consequently he converted
to
Islam.
Almost a hundred
years
after
the death
of Sundiata,
a
powerful king emerged in Mali. His name was Mansa Musa.
During his lifetime
(1312-1337),
his accomplishments
tran-
scended
his
predecessors'.
His empire extended from
east
to west, beginning at the Atlantic Ocean to northern modern
Nigeria;
and from
north
to
south,
reaching
almost
from
central Mauretania and extending to 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 175 ===
the borders of modern
Guinea and the Ivory Coast.
In
1326
a.d. Mansa Musa made a pilgrimage to Mecca,
the Holy City of the Mohammedans.
It

He arrived in the east with thousands of foot soldiers, and
over 60,000 mounted

he gave 20,000 pieces of gold.

Mali,
in

for
its
prosperity and
peace;
within
the empire existed one pervading system
of
law, order, and justice. An African
visitor, Ibn
Batuta, had
this to say about the Sudan: "The inhabitants had a greater
abhorrence of
injustice than any other people. Neither
the
man who travels nor he who stays at home has anything
to
fear from robbers or men of violence." This fact might seem

ing the lifetime of Mansa Musa, commerce increased
on a
large
scale. The merchants
of Mali
established
relay
stations throughout
the empire
at important centers;
these
enterprises reached
the
forest country south
of
the Senegal
and the Niger rivers.
Before
the time of Mansa Musa,
the city of Timbuktu
was founded in the latter part of the eleventh century. Barth
thinks that
it was
first
a small marketplace for the inhabit-
ants of the province of Rad.
Mansa Musa
is not only remembered for his pilgrimage,
trade and military accomplishments, but also for his public
constructions. The king of Mali
built
a
palace and several
mosques
in
the
celebrated
city
of Timbuktu.
At
the
ex-
tremities
of
the
city
of
Timbuktu,
these
mosques
were
erected:
The
mosque
of
Jengere-ber
was
located
in
the
southwest and
the mosque of Sankore was
located
in
the
northern
quarter
of
the
city.
Mansa Musa
was,
indeed,
a
champion
of
Islamic
religion and
learning. This
was
the
time that the city of Timbuktu and Jenne b

with

also
the University of Sankore.59 This
uni-
versity during the period of the dynasty of Askia
the Great
acquired a universal reputation as a university of theology,
law, philosophy, medicine,
history,
etcetera.

When
the emperor Kankan Musa was on

in Arabia, Sagamandir,
the general
of
Mali, took Gao
the
capital of Ghana or Songhay. Then Kankan Musa returned
from Arabia by way of Gao and accepted the capitulation of
the king of Ghana and
its nobles.
Philip
St.
Laurent, who
writes
a monthly
article on
African
history
(see
Tuesday
Magazine) for the Philadelphia Bulletin says that

==================================================

=== CHUNK 178 ===
 the soldiers
of Mali were made prisoners of the ruling family of Dia Soboi
(this was
the
/.a Hebrew Dynasty). Among these
prisoners
were AH Kolon, or Killun, and his brother Selmar Nar, the
sons
of
/.a
Yasebi;
these Hebrew
princes
were appointed
as pages at the court of Mali about 1335 a.d. 60 In the mean-
time, Gao was subjected
under
the
Mali
political
system
says Davidson, and the Mansa Kankan Musa exacted tribute
from
its rulers.
It was not too long before the princes of the Za Dynasty
escaped from the court and army of
Mali. They organized
an army and fought the king of Mali. Ali Kolon entertained
a profound hatred against the Mali conquerors because they
had subjugated
his
people.
In
the
latter
part
of
the
four-
teenth century, the army of Ali Kolon
(later called Sonni,
the liberator, Ali) made attacks on Niani the capital of Mali.
Yearning
for

Sonni

were about seventeen or eighteen Islamic-Hebrew kings in
this dynasty.
THE EMPIRE OF SONGHAY
In
the
year
1464,
the sixteenth61
Za
prince
Sonni
Ali
took the leadership of Gao and began
to build
a new em-
pire. Sonni
Ali
attacked many
of
the
neighboring
tribes,
including the city of Timbuktu, and brought them under
his hegemony. For his strength, he did not depend too much

on the Muslims of
the
cities but primarily on
the
inhabi-
tants
of
the
countryside.
Sonni
Ali
was
not
even
a good
Muslim; he adhered to the traditional religion of Gao and
the Songhay
people.
In almost
every
way, Songhay was
a
greater empire
than
Mali.
Sonni
Ali
systematized
various
schemes of organization and administration unknown by his
predecessors. He
appointed
governors
over
his
territories
and organized a standing professional army consisting of an
echelon, including a
navy, on
the Niger.
The Song

==================================================

=== CHUNK 180 ===
hay empire seems
to have begun
with Sonni
Ali
I.
This was
the time
of
the
decline
of
the empire
of
Mali
in
the
year
1350
a.d., but
the superior vigor of
the
Songhay empire did not occur until
the time of Askia
the
Great.
Now, pertaining to the temperament of Sonni Ali, many
writers
say
that
it
was
uncontrollable. Me
would
put
to
death many of his important
officials and ministers of state,
later wishing they were
alive. Sonni
All's
secretary
at
this
time was
a man named
F.l Cadr for whom Sonni
Ali had
ordered
the
death
penalty
because
of
a
contradiction.
In
the course of time
a book arrived that no one in the king's
court could read but
F.l Gadr;
then
the king expressed
re-
morse
for his rash action;
at that juncture his secretary was
brought
into
his
presence. On
seeing
him,
Sonni
Ali
dis-
played great joy and gave valuable gifts
to those who saved
him.
There
was
another
distinguished
officer
of
the
state,
who
survived
death
in
this
manner,
known
by
various
names such
as Mohammed Tour

==================================================

=== CHUNK 181 ===
e and Abu Rekr who
suc-
ceeded Sonni Ali as Askia the Great.
After Sonni Ali had completed
his business
in Gao,
his
unconquerable
military
impulse
moved
him
on.
He
at-
tacked
to the east and the west expanding the empire. His
predatory acts acquired
for him much
booty, but
a change
of fortune caused his death. When he was crossing the Koni
River, he
fell into the torrent and was drowned. The body
of the great king was prepared and preserved according

Sonni

sometimes
called Abu

succeeded
Sonni Ali on the throne but his reign was very short. After
the death of Sonni Ali,
his most distinguished general, Mo-
hammed Tourc
plunged
the
empire
into
civil
war.
Mo-
hammed Toure fought Sonni Barro at Dangha and defeated
him, then Barro took refuge at Gao, the capital. Mohammed

When
hearing
that Mohammed

seized
the kingdom
from
Barro,
the daughters
of Sonni
Ali were
said
to have
exclaimed, "Askia! Askia! Usurper!"

advocated that Mohammedanism should be spread through-

About
three
years
after
the
civil
war
Askia
emulated
Mansa Kankan Musa
of Mali
by undertaking a long
pil-
grimage to the holy cities in the east. His cavalcade consisted
of a vast number of infantrymen and cavaliers. On
this
pil-
grimage was also a retinue of 1500 princes and chiefs of the
empire. While Askia was in Mecca, he spent
100,000 pieces

101
of gold;
this was more
than any other ruler had spent.
In
Mecca he purchased a garden and set up a charitable
insti-
tution
for
the people of the Sudan. He gave
to the
Khalif
of Bagdad
gifts
that astonished the entire court;
these con-
tributions surpassed
all other kings. The Khalif of Bagdad,
Abassid Motewckkel, was immensely impressed with
Askia.
With
the
Khalif's consent, Askia was made
his deputy
in
Songhay and
as
a
sign
of
his
authority,
the
Khalif
gave
Askia a green
fez and a w

=== CHUNK 184 ===
hite turban.
In
Cairo,
Egypt,
Askia
passed many
hours among
the
religious
scholars,
forming
a
special
acquaintance
with
a scholar named Essoyouti.
It was here in Cairo that Askia
accepted
many
advanced
concepts
about
political
science
which he put into practice in
the Sudan.
Askia returned
to his homeland with an enlarged mind
and many new experiences. Me appointed his brother, Omar,
commander
of
the army, and
lie began
to
consolidate
the
expanding empire
initiated by Sonni
Ali.
Attacking many
tribes
(unbelievers in
Islam), Askia de-
clared war on the Yollofs and the Mossi. At
first, he sent an
ambassador to
the king of the
Mossi, demanding
that
the
king convert to Islam. The king refused and Askia displayed
no mercy in the war that followed. He decimated the Mossi
hamlets and towns, making all the inhabitants prisoners and
forced them
all
to become Muslims. The length of his em-
pire extended from
the Atlantic Ocean beyond Lake Chad
in
I he east.
After the year
1 502 the army of Askia

==================================================

=== CHUNK 185 ===
 invaded the state
of
Mali. The Songhays sustained such
a
large number
of
fatalities
that Omar remarked, "The Songhay
will
be
ex-
terminated." The reply of Askia was: "On the contrary. The
conquered nations will make our lives easier, for they
will
be part of us and will assist us in our enterprises."
Hut Askia
is known for more than
his conquests. Writes
Davidson: "The

"
Whereas Gao was
the
political
capital
of
the Songhay
Empire,
Timbuktu was
the
cultural
capital. Many
of
the
students of Timbuktu,
Gao. and
Jenne, were
sent
to
the
Moslem universities of North Africa, Spain, and Asia. Also,
many
learned men,
irrespective
of
nationality,
were
sum-
moned
to
stay
at
the celebrated
city
of Timbuktu,
where
money was appropriated for their learning.
In order to unite his empire, Askia interlocked the royal
families
by
marriage.
Says Du
Bois:
"The
highest
officers
of
slate were
either chosen
from
the
royal
family or mar-
ried
to
its
princesses, as were
the
principal
military
chiefs,
forming a dynastic aristocracy of the greatest importance
to
national unity."
For better administrative organization, Askia set up four
viceroys
in
his empire; one
in
the east around Lake Chad.
;i second one was in the n

==================================================

=== CHUNK 187 ===
orth around Timbuktu and Gao,
a third one was in the northwest, and a fourth
in the south-
west. Because the government of Songhay was strong, Askia
was able to control the commerce. He built a merchant
fleet
and war
fleet
to
facilitate commerce
in
the
harbors and
canals
that
he
constructed on
the
Niger
River
and
its
branches. As a result, the economy and commerce developed
with
a
tremendous
upsurge. The
city
of Jenne became
a
melting pot
of
internal commerce; Timbuktu
of
interna
tional commerce.
For

of

in

During the lifetime of Askia, north African and Portuguese
ships sailed
to the Songhay port at Kabara,
in the center of
the Niger. In order to perpetuate and
facilitate trade, Askia
Standardized the system of weights and measures. There was
no toleration of highway robbery. Anybody found culpable
of this overt act incurred the utmost punishment.
During

==================================================

=== CHUNK 188 ===
 the reign of Askia
I,
his son, Askia Moussa,
re-
volted and expelled his father. Years
later, with the help of
another son
(Ismail) he returned to Gao, the capital. After
reigning for thirty-five years, he died
in
1538.
Despite
the
fact
that
there
existed
much
debauchery
among
Askia's descendants,
the strong government
he
ere
ated insured
its survival
for many years.
Final chaos came
to Songhay when
the Moors invaded
in
1591. The Moors came
to acquire
wealth;
they
paid
a
dire
price
for
their predatory
exploits. Some
writers
have
estimated that 23,000 Moors perished
in one way or another
in the military campaigns against Songhay. After two decades,
the Moors withdrew their military forces from Songhay,
in
1018.
Basil Davidson has
this to say about Songhay: "But
if
their invasion
cost
the Moroccans much more than
it was
worth,
it cost Songhay
its place
in history. For
it demolished
the unity and

of

EARLY NORTH AFRICA
Many

the
inhabitants
of

Africa
"Berbers,"
but
I

so.
I do not
like
this word
Berber;
first
of
all,
it
is
not
a
native
word
of
Africa,
therefore
it
is misleading. The Greeks and Romans
called
the
people
of North
Africa
"Berbers"
which
means
bar-
barians; however, the people of
this region have their own
names.
The
unbiased
Greek
historian,
Herodotus
(may
honor be given unto him), gives the original names
of the
tribes
of North
Africa.

Zavecians, Gyzan-
tians, Atarantians, and the Atlantes. 1
Herodotus
says
there
are
four
nations
in
Africa;
two
are indigenous,
Ethiopians and
Libyans. The
Phoenicians
and
Greeks
are newcomers. Herodotus
considered
all
the
north African
tribes to be Libyans and
all
the Africans be-
low

in-
digenous nations in Africa. 2
The original inhabitants of North
Africa were Hamitcs;

these Ifamites were black like the Egyptians and
this point
has been proven by Herodotus.'
Because most
of
the
history
in
the western World
has
been distorted,
it becomes necessary for me to explain to you
some of these distortions. Says Hcinrich
Barth, a European
writer:
"The
inhabitants
of Walata4
arc
a 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 191 ===
mixed
race
of
blacks and
whites." Now,
the question
is, "whom docs he
include
as
his
whites? Continues
Barth: "The
whites
are
Berbers and Arabs."
These
Berbers and Arabs were
not
whites
in ancient
times. What
is
his
basis
for calling them
whites? The obvious
reason
is
that he wants
to
attribute
ancient advanced civilization
to
the white race
in order
to
perpetuate the philosophy of white supremacy. Many black
people have
straight
noses and
thin
lips;
the black
people
that possess these qualities arc said to have a white morphol-
ogy
(form). Joseph Williams has this to say about the blacks
of West Africa: "In most mixed group of Negroes a Songhois
may be
identified

certainly, but nothing

to

t
in
their orbits. A
cursory glance shows
that the
profile resembles
that of
the
European."
Some European writers even penetrate into the
blackest Africa and divide the blacks according to the shape
of their noses and
lips. Continues Williams: The Songhays,
"though black-skinned and woolly-haired, their features arc
often
of Caucasian
cast." 7 There arc many colored people
in the United States with straight noses and thin
lips, even
as black as tar; and the Europeans do not classify these
col-
ored people as belonging to the white race. After extensive
research, my conclusion
is this: Some European writers have
classified
certain
tribes
in Africa and Asia
as belonging
to
the white race;
they do
this as long as
it
is psychologically
advantageous,
in order to inflate their ego, and to give them
a prominent place in Afro-Asian
history.

ANAANITES AND PHOENICIANS IN AFRICA
The
language
which
is
called
Hebrew-Phoenician
or
Canaanite
was
employed
in
the
lands
called
Phoenicia,
Palestine, or Canaan
for over a thousand
years before
the
Aramaeans, Abraham,
Isaac, and
Jacob, came
to
Canaan.
The Israelites lost their Aramaic language and adopted the
Hebrew speech
of the Canaanites. The Hebrew-Phoenician
merchants from the cities of Sidon and Tyre controlled the
trade along the Mediterranean coasts for more than a thou-
sand
years
before
there were any economic
treaties made
with
the
Israelites.
The
Hebrew-speaking
Phoenicians
(Canaanites)
established
their
greatest
city,
Carthage
at
Tunis
in
North
Africa;
all
the
Canaanites
were
black
people.
Before the Phoenicians established
their colony
(Carth-
age)
in Africa, many Hebrew-speaking Canaanites had mi-
grated across northern Africa.
One Tosefta, 9 quoting an older source,
says
that when
Joshua
approached
Canaan,
he
told
the
inhabitants
that
three courses were open
to them:

ey could
either
leave
the country, or they could sue for peace, or they could de-
clare war against him. The Girgashites, among others, pre-
ferred to withdraw into Africa. The Tosefta goes on to say
that the Amorites, the Kadmoni, the Kenites and the Kene-
zires—some of whom figure among the founders of Carthage
—also went
to Africa. These
traditions date from
a period
when communication
between
Africa
and
Phoenicia
was
continuous. The proper names
of Girgash and
Kenaz are
often met with in Carthaginian and Phoenician inscriptions.
The Talmud 10 says
that the Canaanites
in Africa asked
Alexander the Great to restore to them their country, which
had been taken from
their ancestors by Joshua ben Nun.

We should not

that
the
Israelites have been

gaged
in commercial
enterprises,
activities, and
migrations
since Solomon's treaty with the Phoenicians.
The Phoenicians established
their metropolis, Carthage,
in
the
ninth
century
B.C.
Eventually
they conquered
the
neighboring
tribes from Libya
to
the
Atlantic Ocean,
dis-
seminating
their Hebrew-Phoenician language and culture
in
every
direction. The Hebrew-Phoenician
language and
culture were invigorated and strengthened by the deporta-

of

"
The population
of Carthage was derived from Palestine
and
its civilization was Hebraic in origin. Slouschz
is certain,
after much research, that the language Hannibal spoke and
in which he
directed
his troops was Hebrew. 14
There
is
evidence
that
the
Carthaginians
possessed
a
high
priesthood and
their ceremonies and
sacrifices
were
similar
to the
rituals found in
the book
of
Leviticus. Ac-
cording
to some
inscriptions,
the Hebrew
tribes
of Asher
and Zebulun were
in Carthage from
the foundation of the
city. At the ruins of Carthage were excavated many inscrip-
tions containing many Hebrew names such
as Joab,
Joas,
and Joel.
The city of Tunis
is said to be neither Arab nor Euro-
pean. Tunis
is
a Jewish
city. Nowhere
else does
the Jew
feel
at home
as he does in Tunis. Slouschz
says
so beauti-
fully: 'And, indeed, Tunis,

For,

And
even

The Final Dispersion of the Black Jews of Africa
109
THE MOORISH EMPIRE
In less than a hundred years, the black Arabs had pushed
their way
completely
across North
Africa
in
the
seventh
century. At
this
time
the Arabs were
black;
they had
not
mixed much with
other people. The Arabs did
penetrate
into
the
interior of
the Sahara
Desert, but only
in
small
numbers so that the territory remained
basically African.
Mulay
Idris,
the descendant
of
Ali,
the
son-in-law
of
Mohammed, brought northern
Morocco under
his control
late in
the seventh century. His son and

==================================================

=== CHUNK 199 ===
 successor was Idris
II, who founded the kingdom of Fez.
At
this time, in the land of Spain, the black Jews were
persecuted and many had
fled
to Morocco
for
refuge. As
a
result of
this
persecution,
the Jews of Morocco and
the
Moors planned to invade Spain with the assistance of Spanish
Jews. In the meantime, the plot was uncovered and the Jews
of Spain suffered
for their
intentions.
Early
in
the eighth
century, the Mohammedans from Morocco, united with
the
black Jews, made what we
call an amphibious
landing
at
Gibraltar. This invasion was successful. Nahun Slouschz says
that: "The first one to set foot on the soil of Spain was Gen-
eral Tarif
(a Jew of the tribe of Simeon), 15 after whom the
island of Tarifa, opposite Tangiers, was named." However,
the Rock
of Gibraltar,
previously known
as
the
Pillars of
Hercules,
received
its new name from
the
great
Moorish
conqueror Gcbel
al Tarik, which means
the mountain
of
Tarik. 10
Here
is
a
vivid account of
the conquering Moors
de-
scribed by a

==================================================

=== CHUNK 200 ===
 writer who sympathized with Christian Spain:
".
.
.
the reins of
their horses were
as

their
faces
black
as

like burning candles,
their
horses were
swift as leopards and

a

at night;
.
.
.
the noble Goths were
broken in an hour, quicker than tongue can
tell. Oh,
luck-
less Spain!" 17
110
From Babylon to Timbuktu
These black Moors ruled over
parts of Spain
for more
than seven hundred
years. During
this time
the Moors de-
veloped
the
greatest
cultural
civilization known anywhere
in Europe.
In the
last half of the eleventh century, there emerged a
powerful
dynasty
of
sultans
from
Senegal,
West
Africa,
known
as
the Almoravides. They
established
their
capital
at Marrakesh, Morocco, and became masters of a new em-
pire
that
included
Senegal,
Morocco,
Algeria,
Tunis,
and
southern Spain;
this empire was even
larger than
western
Europe.
At this time the
first general of the Senegalese was Abu
Bekr, who was supplanted by 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 201 ===
a stronger general, Yusuf ben
Tachfin.
Yusuf's first aim was to construct an elegant capital, with
marvelous
houses,
a
marble-floored
palace,
and
beautiful
flower-beds. The
city
that he
built, Marrakesh or Morocco
City, became the name of
this country.
When
Moorish
power
was
declining
in
Spain,
Yusuf
crossed the Mediterranean
into Spain
in order
to reinforce
Moorish control. He brought 15,000 black troops with him,
and defeated Alphonso VI with his 70,000 Christians
at the
Battle of Zalacca. During the wars of the Almoravides,
the
greatest commander
and
hero
of
Spanish
literature
was
slain;
his name was Roderigo Diaz de Bivar, better known
as El Cid.
The Moors were known
for more
than
just
conquest.
While the remaining part of Europe was in a state of ignor-
ance, the Spanish people took advantage of the knowledge of
the black Moors. During the Moorish rule, many other capi-
tals of Europe were mere hamlets, but Cordova, the capital
of Spain was a booming city.
It
is said that after da

=== CHUNK 202 ===
rk one
could walk many miles in Cordova and never pass through
a street not lighted by public lights. When a person walked
out after dark in London, he had to carry a candle or lantern
with him to illuminate his path and had to wear high shoes
to walk through the thick mud that often covered the roads.

When many Europeans were garbed in skins and in coarse
garments, the Moors were wearing silks,
linens, and cotton
cloth. They
also washed
in
nine hundred bath
houses
of
Cordova.
The
palace
of
the
Moorish
sultan
or
caliph
was
far
greater in beauty, comfort and wealth than any of the castles
of
the medieval
kings. The Moon used extremely
highly
polished marble in their construction. The sides of the walls
were patiently carved, and the floors were made with various
decorations called
mosaics.
It
is
said
that
the Moors were
masters in mosaic work.
The Arabs and Moore were known not only
for their
handicraft, but also for their science. 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 203 ===
Most of the knowledge
of ancient Greece and the Near East was unknown in Europe
during the medieval period. The Arabs had come into close
relationship with Greek and Persian culture. The Arabs did
not destroy
this culture;
instead,
they brought
it
to North
Africa.
There
were
many
famous
Moorish
and
Hebrew
scholars in southern Spain. The black Jews,
like the Arabs
and Moors, made a great contribution not only to Afro-Asian
civilization, but also to the European. The Jews in the East
knew Greek and Syriac. They helped translate the works of
the Greek
philosophers
into
Arabic.
In
turn,
these works
were studied by the Arab-speaking Jews of North Africa and
Spain and
translated
into
the Hebrew. The black Jews
of
the Moorish kingdom of Spain
translated
these works
into
the
Latin
language, and
from
Spain
the
sciences
of
the
Greeks and the Afro-Asian people were transmitted to west-
ern Europe.
Erudite Moorish men made spectacular contributions
to
philosophy,
medicine,
mathematics,
chemistry,


==================================================

=== CHUNK 204 ===
astronomy,
and botany.
The Muslim
doctors were no sawbones, but masters
of
their science.
They established acadamics and universities for the rich;
also,
there were many
free
schools. There
were
excellent
libraries. The scholarly caliph of Cordova, in the tenth cen-
112
From Babylon to Timbuktu
tury, sent all over the world
for books. The library of
this
caliph contained over four hundred thousand volumes.
Moorish normal
life was based on agriculture, manufac-
turing, and
trade. The Moors brought into Spain
rice, cot-
ton,
peaches,
oranges, and
lemons.
Silk
culture was
intro-
duced into Spain by the Moors. The Moors had fine pottery,
glazed
tiles,
silks,
velvet, brocades,
jewels, and ornamental
leather products. Moorish
civilization had a gigantic
effect
on
Portugal and Spain;
this
is
the
reason
that
these two
countries were
the
first European
powers
to emerge
after
the Dark Ages.
In the process of time the Moors were driven southward.
In the eleventh century, El Cid conquered the grea

==================================================

t Moorish
city of Valencia. Much
later,
in the thirteenth century, the
king of
Castile conquered Sevilla and Cordova. Afterward
the Moors were pushed into a small region called Granada.
OUTSTANDING BLACK JEWS
Some of the outstanding black Jews
of
Portugal, Spain
and North Africa were the following:
Hasdai ibn Shaprut, who lived between 925-975. He be-
gan
his career as a physician and continued
his
interest
in
the medical
profession,
especially
in
drugs.
Eventually, he
became physician
to the
Khalif.
Later he rendered
official
advice concerning diplomatic matters. He remained
in
the
center of Hebrew scholars whom he supported. He enter-
tained Moses ben Hanoch, a representative of the Babylonian
academies, who began the foundation of Talmudic learning
in Spain.
Saadia Gaon was born
in 892
in the district of Fayyum,
Upper Egypt. He was learned in the Bible and the Talmud,
in Arabic as in Hebrew
literature, in Greek and Arab phi
losophy. He was one of the
first Hebrew grammarians and
phi

=== CHUNK 206 ===
losophic commentators of the Bible. Saadia composed spe-
cial works on many subjects such as philosophy, astronomy,

geography,
theology,
mathematics,
music,
poetry,
chronol-
ogy, and philology.
Isaac of
Fez, Morocco, or
Alfasi,
so named
because he
came from the city of Fez, lived during the eleventh century.
Although the first important academy was founded by Moses
ben Hanoch
in
Cordova,
the
real
foundation
of
Spanish
talmudic tradition was laid by Alfasi. The interest of Alfasi
was
in Talmudic
law, especially such
as were
vital
for the
Hebrews of the dispersion.
Samuel
ibn Naghdela
lived from
993-1056. He
started
out
as
a
grocer. His acquisition
of knowledge
in
the
lan-
guages, mathematics, and philosophy was extraordinary. Be-
cause Samuel had a beautiful handwriting, he was appointed
secretary of the grand vizier; in
this position he was able to
put to good use his wisdom and knowledge. When the vizier
died. Samuel succeeded him 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 207 ===
as adviser to the Moorish king
of Granada. On several occasions, he was appointed
as
the
head of the Moorish armies of Granada.
Samuel ibn Naghdela was respected also in Jewish circles.
The king of Granada elevated him to the position of Nagid;
that
is, prince or leader of the Jews.
Moses Maimonides was
the outstanding black Jew
dur-
ing the Middle Ages; he
is known
as Rambam
(Rabbcnu
Moshe ben Maimon). Moses was born in Cordova on March
30,
1 135,
the eve of the Passover. His father, Maimon, was
an offspring of a great family of scholars and religious lead-
ers.
His
family
tree
has been
traced
to Rabbi Judah
the
Prince,
the composer of
the Mishmah,
to
the
royal house
of David.
While
the Talmud and
Rabbinics were
the chief
sub-
jects of Maimonides, he dedicated time
to the sciences that
were
taught
and
postulated
by
the
ancient
Greeks
and
medieval Arabs. He received his learning under Hebrew and
Moorish
teachers, and
before long he
was
learned
in
the
natural
sciences,
mathematics,
medi

cine,
metaphysics,
phi-
losophy, and logic.
114
From Babylon to Timbuktu
In
the
year
1145, when
Moses
was
ten
years
of
age,
Abdul lah-ibn-Tumart,
a
religious
fanatic,
founded
the
Dynasty of the Almohades.
The Almohades, who proclaimed a religion
of absolute
Monotheism, succeeded, after many battles, in expelling the
Almoravidcs
(black Moors from
the highland of Morocco)
and
established
their own
rule
over
the
Moorish
empire.
The Almohades directed
a reign
of terror and
persecu-
tion
not
only
against Judaism and
Christianity,
but
also
against
sectarianism
in
Islam. The
Almohades
displayed
their
intolerance
for other
religions. There
were
prohibi-
tions against the existence of churches and synagogues. Jews
and
Christians were
given
the one
alternative,
Islam
or
death.
Ahdulmumen,
who
succeeded
Abdullah-ibn -Tumart,
permitted heretics to depart from his country. The Christian
exiles found asylum
in northern
Spain.
It was
difficult
for
the Jews
to find a place of security, and many of the

==================================================

=== CHUNK 209 ===
m died
by the sword as martyrs for their religion. Some of the Jews
converted to Islam as a disguise, and remained loyal
to their
own faith, practicing Judaism in secret.
About the middle of the twelfth century, when Maimon-
ides was
thirteen
years
of age,
the Almohades
crossed
the
Mediterranean
into Spain and
established
their power
in
Andalusia.
In
the
late spring
of
that
year,
the Almohades
invaded the city of Cordova, and instituted a reign of terror
and persecution. The magnificent synagogues were destroyed,
the Talmudic schools at Seville and Lucena were closed, and
non-believers in Islam
(Jews and Christians) were given the
alternatives of Islam, expulsion, or death.
Because of all
this turmoil and social unrest,
the family
of Moses Maimonides decided to depart from
that inhospit-
able land and
to sail across
the Mediterranean
to Morocco
in northern Africa. They remained
in
the
city of Fez
for
about
five years and then traveled to Palestine. Because the
environment was not condu

Moses moved
to Egypt.
The Final Dispersion of the Black Jews of Africa
1 15
Moses Maimonides continued
his
studies
in
medicine;
his fame
as
a physician now spread throughout Egypt and
beyond.
It
is said that Moses was offered a position as a phy-
sician
to
King
Richard
the
Lion-Hearted
(leader
of
the
Third Crusade). When
Moses was about
fifty years of
age,
he was appointed
by Alfadhel,
the Vizier of
Egypt,
as
his
own medical
adviser, and he was given a place among the
royal physicians.
Moses was also a great leader and judge of the Egyptian
Jewish community. His son followed
in
his footsteps
(reli-
giously and secularly) receiving the leadership of the Jewish
communities and as physician to the Sultan.
Other outstanding black Jews of Spain were poets such
as: Solomon ibn Gabirol, Moses ibn Ezra, and Judah ha-Levi.
THE EXPULSION OE THE JEWS FROM
SPAIN AND PORTUGAL
It was a.d. 1492 (January 2nd), when the Moorish strong-
hold of Granada surrendered
to
the armies of King

==================================================

=== CHUNK 211 ===
 Ferdi-
nand and Queen
Isabella. For the
first time since
the year
711,
all
of
Spain
was
in
Christian
hands. The
decree
to
expel the Jews from Spain was signed on March
31, in one
of
the
corridors of
the
great Alhambra,
the
palace
of
the
Moorish kings of Granada. The reason given for the expul-
sion of the Jews was that
it was thought they corrupted the
Marranos
(Jews converted
to Christianity) by privately en-
couraging them in disloyalty to Christianity. The ultimatum
given to the Jews expired August
I,
1492. But the last group
of Jews did not
leave until August 2,
1492. This date
is of
strange coincidence. That day was the
9th
of Ab,
the
fast
day which
is reminiscent of the destruction of the First and
Second Temples.
Professor Allen H. Godbey says
that
the
reign of the
last Jewish king of Ghana terminated in
1492.
In order to satisfy Queen
Isabella of Spain, King Manocl
of Portugal promulgated
a royal decree expelling the Jews
and Moors from
his country in
1496. The Jews who were
1

==================================================

=== CHUNK 212 ===
16
From Babylon to Timbuktu
expelled from Spain and Portugal were scattered throughout
the Mediterranean
coasts.
It
is estimated
that over
100,000
Jews departed from Spain and Portugal during the persecu-
tions and the expulsion. Some of these Jews went
to north-
ern Europe,
Italy, and Turkey; but most of them went
to
Moslem countries
of northern and western Africa." These
black Jews would naturally go to African countries most of
all. because of less persecution and they could disguise them-
selves easily among blacks.
R. II. M. Klwes 10 gives a graphic description of the Portu-
guese
Jew,
Baruch
Spinoza:
"Middle-sized, good
features,
skin somewhat black, black curly hair, long eyebrows of the
same color, so that one might know by his looks that he was
a descendant from Portuguese Jews."
When the Jews were expelled from Spain, about
100,000
entered
Portugal. They were permitted
to enter under
the
condition that they pay the poll
tax. with the understanding
that they would leave the co

=== CHUNK 213 ===
untry within eight months. Also
at
this
time
the
king
obligated
himself
to
take
the Jews
wherever
they
desired
at
the
termination
of
the
eight
months. When
the time expired, many Jews were stranded
because the king did not provide enough ships in time. All
the black Jews who were
left behind were deprived of their
freedom and sold
into slavery.
During the reign
of King Joao
II
(or John
II), seven
hundred black Hebrew children were ruthlessly taken aw.iv
from their parents in Portugal and transported to the island
of San Thome. ofT the west coast of Africa. 20 This island
is
I. uated near Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon. Allen
II. God-
hey
says
that
the
Portuguese
founded
the
island
of
San
Thome in
1171. In the year 1484, King John
II of Portugal,
who reigned from
1481-1495, offered
the Jews of
his king
dom the choice of baptism or settling at San
1 home.
Multi-
tudes
of Jews were sent
to
this
island during
the
reign
ol
King John
II.* These
Jews,

the
Portuguese
called them, are

The
Portuguese were
the
first
Europeans
to
establish
themselves on
the
west
African
coast. They came
first
as
merchants, and secondly as conquerors and slavers. Later in
this work, the black Jews in the Portuguese
possessions in
West Africa will be discussed in greater detail.
Now,
let us return to the Jews of North Africa.
With the influx of tens of thousands of black Jews from
Spain and Portugal seeking refuge in African ports, Morocco
received
a
great
share. Put before
this date many Jewish
tribes were entrenched
in Fez, the Atlas, and the desert. In
Morocco there was a revival of Moorish and Jewish science
in all areas. The Hebrew academy in Fez competed with the
one in Kairuan, Algeria. There were many debates and
lec-
tures between the sages and scholars of these schools. Eldad,
the Danite,
a Hebrew from
the Jewish kingdom
of Ghana
visited these schools i

==================================================

=== CHUNK 215 ===
n the ninth century.
There was a celebrated Hebrew college
at Sijilmasa,
in
the desert, south
of
Fez. The school
of Sijilmasa produced
many
illustrious scholars. There were grammarians, masters
of Talmudic law, poets, and philologists.
This period of Jewish scholarship came to an end when
the
fanatical Almohades
("Unitarians") went on
the war-
path
in
11-15 and destroyed the city of Sijilmasa;
this reign
of terror was carried out against
all non-Muslims. Concern-
ing the destruction of Sijilmasa Ibn Ezra writes:
"I
say,
let
there
be
mourning
for
the community
of
Sijilmasa, city of great scholars and sages; she sees her light
covered with shadows; the pillars of the Talmuds were shat-
tered; the temple of law was destroyed and the Mislmah was
trodden under foot."
There are many Jewish
tribes and settlements through-
out Morocco and
the Sahara
Desert: The
Ait
Moussa,
or
Beni-Moussa, "Sons of Moses,"
is one of the spectacular Jew-
ish
tribes. Leo Africanus,
a
Moorish converted Jew,
states

==================================================

=== CHUNK 216 ===

that: "The Jews of North Africa are
of
a hybrid
quality:
They have proselytized and inter-married among the Greeks,
Vandals,
Romans,
Spaniards, and
Portuguese." The Jews
118
From Babylon lo Timbuktu
intermarried among the Greeks when
the
latter established
their colony in Libya called Cyrenaica; some intermarriages
occurred between Jews, Romans, and Vandals when the
lat-
ter two invaded North Africa; and before the Jews were ex-
pelled from Spain and Portugal there were some intermar-
riages.
Considering
all
this
intermingling, many
Jews
of
North
Africa
still
retain much
of
their
colored
features.
According to Maurice Fishburg
(who was quoted by Allen
Godbey)
lie "was unable
to distinguish
a Jew from
a Mo-
hammedan while passing along the
streets of Algiers, Con-
stantine
(a city of northern Africa), and Tunis.
It
is remark-
able that among the non-Jewish natives there are seen many
Jews of Negroid type." 22
Fishburg visited Africa during the early part of the twen-
tieth century.
The

==================================================

=== CHUNK 217 ===
re
are
black Jews
living in
the multitude
of
oases
in
the
Sahara
Desert. Nahum
Slousthz,
the
white
Jewish
rabbi,
visited
these Jews
of North
Africa and
the
Sahara
during the turn
of
this
century.
Slouschz obtained
his
in-
formation
of
these Jews from
three sources:
(1) from
the
historical records of the Arabs,
(2) from
the oral
traditions
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
Sahara,
(3)
from
archeological
evidence excavated from
the
ruins
of old Jewish
cities
in
the
Sahara
and
Sudan,
which
date
from
the
thirteenth
century.
About half way down the eastern border of Algeria, there
are large settlements of black Jews at a place called Wargla,
says Slouschz. Jews were at Wargla
as early as 620
a.d.
ac-
cording to Godbey. Again Godbey says "In the Wargla oasis
of Algeria, 350 miles from the Mediterranean,
is a colony of
Jews
'as black
as Negroes.' "
In the Gharian section of Libya, not too far from Wargla,
there exists the troglodyte Jews.
It
is reported that the Jews

be-
cause of Roman and Arab persecution. Godbey quotes
II.
S.
Cowpcr who says that the Jews of the city of Tripoli assert
that
they migrated from
Gharian. These Jews constructed
The Final Dispersion of the Black Jews of Africa
1 19
subterranean synagogues and underground houses. Slouschz
visited the strongholds of these troglodyte Jews in the early
part of this century. The Jews had built compartments three
and
four
stories underground, containing
a
population
of
thirty thousand. Godbey says
that:
"Hesse-Wartegg
visited
their
cities
of
Beni-Abbas,
Jebel
Nefussa,
Yehud
Abbas.
Tigrena, Jebel
Iffren." They had shops, stores, schools, and
synagogues,
all underground.
The achievements of these Jews prove what a persecuted
society can do under adverse conditions. These Jews had
a
foundation
to
build
on,
unlike
other
persecuted
people;
they had their history, culture, laws, language, and
skills.
Between Wargla and the Gharian, there
is a Jewish town
called Tigrena.
Here,

==================================================

=== CHUNK 219 ===

the Jews have
also constructed
sub-
terranean compartments. Nahum Slouschz. says he was guided
to an ancient synagogue which was located underground;
at
this time he made an
extensive observation
of
the
village
which contained twenty underground courts and
its 700
in-
habitants;
also,
he
found
there
a
young man
teaching
Hebrew."
When Slouschz was in this city about one hour, the men
had
just returned from
the market:
Slouschz says they are
"all
of a
fine, dark
type." The rabbi was descended from
Jews who had immigrated from Morocco.
The
rabbi,
at
this
time, informed Slouschz of
the
fact
that
there
existed
in
the

tion but
that epidemics, wars and frequent conversions

reduced
their number." On one
occasion
Slouschz met a Jewish
itinerant merchant of Nefoussa who
had ju

st arrived from Fezzan;
this Jew had traveled all the
routes of
the Sahara;
he assured
Slouschz
that other Jews
existed
at
least in the east Sudan
(Chad, Sudan, and Ethio-
pia), "A black-skinned population which some call the Felici
and which
are generally known among
the Tauregs
as
the
120

They observe
the
Sabbath and
are known
to be
of
Jewish origin." 26
Many of the
tribes
in
the Sahara and
in
the Sudan arc
Moslems in religion but are Hebrew in nationality. Nahum
Slousclu
says: "Numbers of
these
Islamized Jews may
be
found everywhere." They are among the Nomads of Algeria,
the Smul, the Hanansha, the Traras, the Masmata, the Mua-
jerin, the Kabyles, the Tuat; you will
find them among the
Ureshfana, the Ghariani, the Brami in Tripoli; you will find
them in southern Morocco among the powerful clans of the
Daggatuns, who control the routes to the Sudan and south-
ward. They are non-Jewish by
religion but aware
of
their
Hebrew origin. They arc friendly to t

he Jewish merchants.
Frequently the Jew
is the only communication between these
tribes and the outside world. 50
The Daggatun Jews are scattered in clans through many
caravan route oases of
the Sahara and
the Sudan. Godbey
says the word Daggatun means traders; they are located near
Timbuktu and hundreds of miles northward;
they are
also
found east of Timbuktu and Gao.
The two main factors that motivated the black Jews to
penetrate into North Africa were commerce and persecution;
also, these two factors impelled them to migrate into central
Africa which
is known as the Sudan,

I can
positively
say

that where Mohammedanism
is currently prevailing
in
the
Sudan, Judaism once had been dominant.
There
is much proof, and still much more to be revealed
by scholars,
that there existed prior
to
the slave trade and
subsequent to
it many Jewish tribes, colonies, and kingdoms
in West Africa:
The
Moorish
writer, Leo Africanus,
informs
us of
the
past existence of a medieval Hebrew
state called Kamnuria
or Kanuria;
its two main cities were Kamnuri
(obviously
its
capital) and Naghira; and this state was located north of the
Senegal
River. According
to
this Moorish Jew,
this
black
African Hebrew state had vanished by his time. There are
two reasons given for the ruin of this kingdom:
(1) The in-
tensive sandstorms of the Sahara Desert caused droughts and
rendered the cities uninhabitable;
(2)
the migration of th

==================================================

=== CHUNK 223 ===
e
Fulas or Fulbe toward the West. The Kanuri
call the Fulas
"Fellata";
these Fulas transmigrated the entire Sudan from
the Nile to Senegal. The Kanuri Jews are now located in the
central Sudan along
trails hundreds of miles
north,
south,
east
and
west
of
Lake Chad
where
they
migrated
from
Senegal. 27
It
is the conclusion of some scholars that when the Jew-
ish kingdom of Ghana
fell, many of the Hebrew tribes estab-
lished settlements among the African tribes throughout cen-
tral and western Africa. 28
Thus, the Moorish writer, Al Edrisi, of Andalusia, Spain,
wrote
in
the
early
part
of
the
twelfth
century about
the
powerful Hebrew colony of Lamlam. Lamlam was situated
about two hundred miles west of Timbuktu. The Hebrew
merchants were then monopolizing the trade that was con-
centrated
at Timbuktu. Lamlam
was
entirely Jewish
and
she fought wars
to maintain her control
of
trade. 20
Fdrisi also said that there were only two towns south of
the Kingdom of Ghana and continues: "According to 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 224 ===
what
the people of this country report, the inhabitants are Jews."
When
they
had
reached
the
age
of
puberty
they
were
branded on the countenance or at
least on the temple with
122

fire,
leaving
identifying
marks.
All
the dwellings
in
their
countries were
built on
the bank
of a
river, which
flowed
into
the
Nile.'
F.drisi meant
the Niger
River.
It was
the
belief of the time that the Niger formed an upper reach of
the
Nile.
The black African Hebrews had settlements not only in
the interior of Africa; but they also had communities on the
west coast of Africa from Morocco to Angola.
In
the year
1856
Dr.
J.
I.. Wilson wrote
his
history
of
western Africa: He transmits
to
us the composite
religious
culture of some of the inhabitants of Senegambia
(or Sene-
gal) and Guinea;
in
Senegal, he
said,
there
"is a complete
medley of paganism, Judaism, and Mohammedanism, and
it
is difficult to say which of the three occupies the most promi-
nent
place, or exerts
the greatest
inf

==================================================

=== CHUNK 225 ===
luence upon
the
char-
acter of the people." However, the sentiment of the inhabit-
ants
regarding
this
multi-religious
mixture
was
that
the
combination
of the
three religions furthered the welfare of
all.
How do we rationalize and explain the medley of pagan-
ism. Judaism, and Mohammedanism near
the ruins
of
the
medieval Jewish kingdom of Kamnuria?
It
is obvious to re-
searchers
that
after
the break-up of
the Hebrew kingdoms
of Ghana, Kamnuria, and I-amlam, the black Jews migrated
to remote regions of the interior and
the coast; then
these
Hebrews came under
the
pressure
of Moslem
propaganda
and pagan influence, resulting in what
is known as "cultural
diffusion.'*
If you
recall what Slouschz
said, many Jews be-
came Moslems but
still retained their Jewish origin.
Wilson
also informs
us
that
in northern Guinea
there
is
a
conglomeration
of Judaism and
paganism
combined,
and in southern Guinea there
is a combination of Judaism,
paganism,
and
some
traces
of
Christianity.
In

Guinea

is more highly prac-
ticed; some
of

rites

period

cloths and
ashes; bloody animal
sacrifices, with
the careful
sprinkling of blood upon
the door posts and the
altars;
the
division of the tribes into different families, frequently into
twelve parts
(the twelve tribes of Israel); formal processions,
circumcision, and
various other
practices, probably
of He-
brew derivation. A few of these rituals, especially circumci-
sion, might have been derived from
the
Moslems, but we
are forced
to consider the entire congeries
of
the Hebrew
cultural
trails which
is indicative of the Hebrew religion.
Wilson
says:
"Although
the
natives
of
Africa
retain
these outward rites and ceremonies with the utmost tenacity,
they have
little or no knowledge of their origin, or the
par-
ticul

=== CHUNK 227 ===
ar

which
they
are
intended
to commemorate.
Many of them are performed to shield themselves from some
threatened
evil, or to secure some coveted good. Rut
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
they
are
attended merely
as
a
matter of habit; and the only reason assigned
for observing
them
is that
their ancestors did the same before them."*
1
It stands to good reason that
if their ancestors observed
these Hebrew
riles, they were surely Hebrews.
1
1
is written: "They have said, come and let us cut them
off from being a nation;
that the name of Israel may be no
more in their remembrance."82
Like
the
black Jews
in America, some
of
the
Jews
of
Guinea don't remember their original
nationality. 'Ibis de-
plorable ignorance
is attributed
to various causes:
(1) The
fall of the Hebrew kingdoms,
(2) the lack of communication
with Jewish educational centers
(3) intense persecution, and
the deliberate blotting out of the mind their true national-
ity. Thus, Nahum

he

"In
most
cases
these Hebrews by

come
a burden
to them." In another example, the persecu-
tion of the black Jews
in
Portugal was so ruthless and
fre-
quent
that
Cecil Roth"
tells
us
the Jews did
not divulge
to their children
the secret of their religion until they had
attained the age of reason. The Hebrew religion
is such that
124
From Babylon to Timbuktu
if you deny your
religion, you
will
eventually deny
your
nationality. The sociologists and psychologists know, and his-
tory has proven that,
if you deny your culture and nationality
over a long period of time you will totally forget
it through
a process of assimilation.
The black Jews came to Africa not only by land but also
by sea. As you recall, in the year 1484 King John of Portugal
deported great numbers of black Jews to the African island
of San Thome. The island of San Thome, near Nigeria and
the Cameroon, was discovered by
the
Portuguese
in

==================================================

=== CHUNK 229 ===

1471
and
it was established as a penal colony;
to
this island Jews
were sent who would not accept baptism.
It
is obvious that
the Jews were deported to San Thome not only to mete out
punishment
to them;
but King John's ulterior motive was
to establish a commercial base with sophisticated black Jews
in his growing empire in Africa. As time elapsed,
the black
Jews
in
Portugal and
the
black
Jews
in
the
Portuguese
colonial
possessions became known
as
"black
Portuguese."
They were called black Portuguese because they were born
in Portugal and they knew the history, culture and language
of Portugal.
As it has been mentioned before, King John 34 of Portugal
furnished ships in order
to deport the Jews
to any country
they
desired;
however,
unscrupulous
Portuguese
captains
exacted
as much money
as
they could from
the Jews and
dumped their human cargo at various places along the west
African
coast. As a
result, Allen Godbey
writes
that Win-
woode
Rcade 35 met
blacks
in
Guinea, West
Africa, who
c

and

from
Portugal; Reade wrote
his book
in
1864.
In another case
Daniel
P. Mannix
writes
us
that Captain
Cutler,
a
slave
trader
from
Boston,
was
"barbarously
murdered,
.
.
. with
two of his sailors, by a community of black Portuguese estab-
lished near the mouth
of the Sierra Leone River."38
The Portuguese were the
first Europeans to trade on the
West African coast, and to establish colonies on a large scale:
The Canary
Islands were discovered
by
the Portuguese
in

tants were
black Jews deported
here
in
1484; black Jews migrated
to the Angola coast from San
Thome between
1484 and
1499;
the white Portuguese
mis
sionaries reached Angola by
1560, but white settlers did not
establish a community until
1575.
Let us return now
to
the Jews
of San Thome
Island.
Scholars are uncertain concerning the exact number of Jews
deported to this island;
it
is certain that the number lies in
the thousands and perhaps the tens of thousands. Continuous
research
is needed
in African Hebrew
history, especially in
the
excavation
of ruined Hebrew
cities
of
Africa. When
this gigantic work
is completed,
I believe the evidence will
reveal information
that will amaze humanity.
It
is my
sin-
cere
belief
that
a
greater number
of black Jews were
de-
ported
to
the western
coast
of Africa
than
is admitted by
some writers.
By the edict of King Manoel of Portugal in 1496
(banish-
ing
the Jews
from
Portugal),
all Jews were
to be out
of
Portugal by October
1497. However, considering


==================================================

=== CHUNK 232 ===
this mat-
ter, he decided to Christianize the Jews, fearing the
loss of
a valuable population. He wanted the continued use of their
knowledge and services. He concluded that the only way the
Jews could be
tolerated
in
his country was
to
force them
into
the Christian
faith.
In March
1497, a command was
proclaimed
throughout
Portugal
for
all Hebrew
children
between four and fourteen
years of age
to be brought
for
baptism. All parents who did not bring their children volun-
tarily had their children taken away violently by the officials
and forced into baptism. Cecil Roth writes:
"Scenes of indescribable
horror were witnessed
as
they
126
From Babylon to Timbuktu
were
torn away
by
the
royal
bailiffs. The
latter
did
not
obey their instructions loo closely, frequently seizing young
people of both sexes up to the age of twenty. In many cases,
parents smothered their offspring in
their farewell embrace.
In others, they threw them into wells in order to save them
from
the disgrace of apostasy, 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 233 ===
and
then
killed
themselves.
Sometimes, even old men were dragged to the churches and
forcibly baptized by over-zealous
fanatics." 37
Horrendous
conditions
like
these
(and much
worse),
compelled many Jews to escape secretly out of the country.
These black Jews went to Portuguese colonial possessions in
western Africa. 38 Remember that the Portuguese colonics in
western
Africa
were Guinea, San Thome
Island,
Senegal,
Angola, and a few islands near the African coast. During the
persecutions in Portugal, thousands of Jews left the country.
The Jews were leaving the country
in such
large numbers
that
in
1199 and
1531
the kings published a decree forbid-
ding the New Christians
(black Jews) from leaving Portugal
without special permits. 38
At
this time many Jews became Christians out of
fear;
many of them were known as secret Jews, practicing Judaism
in
secret under the guise of Christianity. Some
writers
call
these Jews nominal
Christians, Jews who are
Christians
in
name only, but practiced 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 234 ===
Judaism in secret. 40
In
spite of
all
the prejudices against the black Jews
of
Portugal, ihey excelled
in
all
the
trades,
skills,
professions,
and
businesses. The
wealth
of
the Jews
was
tremendous.
Portugal
is
a
small country about
the
size
of
the
state
of
Florida; nevertheless, in the year 1610, the Jews alone were
worth
80,000,000
ducats. The
Jews dominated commerce
and the export
trade; so naturally the black Jew would en-
gage
in commerce and trade in many parts
of Africa,
after
they had
fled from Portugal.
The Final Dispersion of the Black Jews of Africa
127
THE BLACK JEWS OF ANGOLA
In
the country called the Gabon near the Congo,
there
were black Jews known
as the Bavumbu; some writers
call
them by various names such as Mavambo, Ma-Yomba, Ma-
yuniba, and Mavumbu. Abbe Proyart, a French writer, says
that these fews held the coast of Loango between the Congo
River and Rio Muni in Gabon, In 1770 their country began
about sixty miles from
the coast and extended north from
the Congo ab

==================================================

=== CHUNK 235 ===
out two hundred
miles.
In appearance
these
black Jews are hardly distinguishable from
the other
Afri-
cans.
It
has been
reported
that
these Jews
practice some
divination and magic
like
native
Africans.
However,
they
observe some Jewish ceremonies, and
live
in separate com-
munities, not considering themselves
native
Africans. The
villages of
these Jews are situated along the Loango Coast
for more than
a hundred
miles, even south
of
the Congo
River. Godbey
writes
that when
they
are
interrogated
in
regard to their origin, some of these Jews said they migrated
from
the
south
(probably
Angola); some from
the
north
(probably Nigeria); some from the other side of the moun-
tains
(perhaps
Ethiopia).
Like
the
Portuguese
Jews,
tire
Bavumbu Jews were very active in commerce.41
When
David
Livingstone
was
in
Africa,
he discovered
a settlement of educated blacks about
the year
1847;
they
were
located
inland
about
two
hundred
miles
from
the
Loanda Coast, and arc known as "the Jews of Angola." These


==================================================

=== CHUNK 236 ===
black Jews were
active
in commerce,
eager
to
learn, and
possessed much knowledge
of Portuguese
history and
law.
In
their commercial
enterprises,
these Jews penetrated
in-
land hundreds of miles from the coast and were known also
as clerks and writers. Livingstone42 considered these Jews to
be deportees from Portugal. St. Paul de Loanda began,
like
San Thome, as a penal colony for the punishment of crimi-
nals;
in Portugal many of these black Jews were considered
criminals. Also many
of
these
black
Jews
of
the
land
of
128
From Babylon
lo Timbuktu
Angola,
it
is said, came from San Thome
Island. All
avail-
able evidence
indicates
that
the Jews
of
the Angola
coast
were Portuguese Jewish outcasts.
Many black Jews were established inland and along
the
coast
of Angola,
the Congo, and Gabon.
Friedrich
Rat/el
writes that the tribes on the Loango Coast and the Cabinda
north of the Congo River were once Christianized.
Rat/.el
observed
a ceremony of baptism
followed by circumcision.
However,
these

==================================================

=== CHUNK 237 ===

tribes were
Jewish
in
origin. The
Chris-
tianity Rat/el saw among them was a disguise; the circumci-
sion
practiced among them
is
of
Jewish
derivation. The
Christians in Portugal did not practice circumcision;
in fact,
Cecil Roth wrote that circumcision among Jews in Portugal
was practically an impossibility;
for
its discovery was equal
to a death sentence. Godbey wrote concerning the Mavumbu
Jews on the Loango Coast:
"It seems that
the Mavumbu may be the remnant of
a
much more numerous Judaism
that was vigorously assailed
by Portuguese missionaries. The Abbe Proyart records that
nominal
Christians
(secret Jews) once numbered hundreds
of thousands."48
Whenever
the Jews
were
in
Spain,
Portugal, or
their
colonial
possessions, they disguised themselves as Christians
in outward form, but
practiced Judaism
in secret. Many of
these new
Christians knew
Christian
rites
better
than
the
old white Christians.
In
the
year
1517,
the papal
office authorized the
estab-
lishment of the system of
the


==================================================

=== CHUNK 238 ===
Inquisition
in
Portugal;
the
word inquisition means inquiry or investigation. The Inqui-
sition consisted of a tribunal of religious judges;
its purpose
was
to
investigate and purge out
heretical
Christians,
per-
sons who questioned certain Christian
principles. Although
some white
Portuguese Christians suffered
at
the hands of
the
Inquisition,
this system was mainly directed against the
new Christians, the secret black Jews. The Inquisitions were
persistent, gruesome, and
ruthless
in
the
totality
of
their
procedures: They
interfered
in
the
private
affairs
of

victuals; they intimidated and coerced individuals to inform
on
their neighbors;
they employed
a wide
variety
of
con-
tinuous
horrendous
tortures,
including
public
shows
of
burning human beings at the stake, and, in order to satisfy
their
desires
for
the punishment
of
heretics,
they
sought
out not only the living, but also the dead.
Garcia d'Orta, a Jew of Portugal, was di

==================================================

=== CHUNK 239 ===
scovered to have
been a secret Jew; his body was dug up out of his grave and
burned by
the
Inquisition. 14
In another case,
a Jewish woman by the name of Elvira
del Campo was indicted and tortured for two years in order
to elicit a confession from her. The charges against her were
not
eating pork and
putting on clean
linen on Saturdays.
According
to
this woman,
these charges were not heretical
practices, she wanted to be clean and pork made her sick."
Whenever
the Christian Jews could escape from
Spain
and Portugal beyond the reach of the Inquisition, they threw
off the guise of Christianity and practiced Judaism openly,
as
they
did
in
Turkey. 4 "
However,
the
unfortunate new
Christians (nominal Christians, or secret Jews) in Portuguese
possessions in western Africa, India, and elsewhere could not
throw off the disguise of Christianity. The Inquisition even
dispatched
its
Inquisitorial
agents
to
the
Canary
Islands,
Madeira, Guinea,
India, South America, San Thome, and
Angola
in order
t

==================================================

=== CHUNK 240 ===
o search out
secret Jews. From
15G1
to
1628 about 3,800 individuals were tried: many of them were
Christian Jews of San Thome Island; they were charged with
maintaining Jewish principles, Cecil Roth wrote that Chris-
tian
Jews emigrated to the Portuguese colony of Angola
in
West
Africa where agents
of
the
Inquisition were
sent
to
hunt them out in
1626. 47
Now,
we
can
understand why
writers
like
Friedrich
Rat/el considered the tribes along
the I.oango and Cabinda
coast "Christians";
these Jews had
to maintain
a Christian
guise and
particularly
so
in
the
presence
of white
people.
Any European could have been an agent of the Inquisition.
It
is
certain
that many
black
Jews
of
Portugal,
San
130
fro hi Babylon to Timbuktu
Thome, and Angola who became victims of the Inquisition
and Portuguese
persecution, were
sold
in
the
slave
trade.
This Atlantic
slave trade
lasted more than 400 years, from
1441 to about 1880 in some parts of South America.
Some scholars have located black Jews within the e

THE JEWS AMONG THE ASHANTEES
Among
the Ashantces
of
the Gold Coast
(Ghana)
are
found Jews who observe many Hebrew customs: They don't
light on
Saturday
but
they
rest. They
celebrate
the New
Year of the Jews which occurs
in September or early Octo-
ber; they used the word "Amen" at the end of their hymn
of
thanksgiving;
like
the Hebrews
of
old,
they

they
perform
cross-cousin

YORUBA JEWS OF NIGERIA
There are black Jews in southern Nigeria who are called
the "Emo Yo Qualm,"
or "Strange
People," by
the
native
Africans, but these black Jews call themselves by the Hebrew
name
"IJ'nai Ephraim" or "Sons of Ephraim." These Jews
claim
that
their ancestors immigrated from Morocco, a
fact
which Godbey says
is "supported by
their language,
a mix-
lure of Maghrebi Arabic and local Negro speech.
Thus ubu
("father") has become yaba, umm
("mother"); Hebrew em
is una."
Nevertheless, most
of
their language
is
similar
to
the
black Yorubas around
them. The Yorubas have
influ-
enced
these Jews
to a great extent
in
their external
social
life;

is said that the crocodile

==================================================

=== CHUNK 244 ===

of
the
Yorubas appear
to
be
the
same for the Jews.
The assertion of these Yoruba Jews
is that their ancestors
were driven from locality to locality by Moslem persecution;
they did not find rest even when they arrived at Timbuktu.
Surely
the prophecy has been
fulfilled: "And among these
nations shall thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy
foot
have
rest: but
the Lord shall give thee there
a
trem-
bling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind."55 These
Yoruba Jews lived in the Ondo district when Godbey wrote
fS2
From Babylon to Timbuktu
in 1930; this district
is nine hundred miles southeast of Tim-
buktu. When Godbey wrote, they numbered about two thou-
sand people in twenty small hamlets.
Pertaining
to their Hebrew
political
structure and
cul-
ture,
they have seven hereditary heads of
the community;
their leadership
is that of a priesthood. They are known to
have copies of portions of the Torah
(Old Testament) pre-
served
in a "most holy
place," however,

hi
almost
every
way,
these
black Jews
are
like
the
Vortibas, and are hardly distinguishable from them, except
for some outstanding Hebrew observances. One of the most
notable among
these black Jews was a young man named
Bata Kindai Amgoza, ibn Lo
Bagola, who was taken from
Whydah, Dahomey,
to Scotland. After he had received four
years of the white man's education, he returned to his home
in Africa. 66
Dr. Allen H. Godbey postulates
the position
that black
fens were on the west African coast from Senegal
to Angola
and they, the Jews, were driven to this area from the Central
Sudan by Moslem propagandism. 57 Having a knowledge of
the black
Jews in the United
Stales, Dr. Godbey arrived at
this conclusion:

Before Dr. Godbcy published his book, The Lost Tribes

in
1918 and proclaimed that the black people of the United
States and the West Indies are the original black Hebrews. 60

the
revelation
of ample
historical
evidence,
the
authenticity or
these black Hebrews can no longer be
questioned;
however,
in
regard
to
the
purity
of
their
Judaism among some of these Jews,
that
is another
issue.
CONCLUSION
According to biblical prophecy, the black Hebrews were
supposed
to have gone into slavery and
captivity. Thus we
read of
the prophet Jeremiah
saying:
"Judah
is gone
into
captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude:
she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:
all her
persecutors overtook her between
the
straits."81
Prophecy
is similar to history
in one
respect,
that
is,
it
repeats
itself.
Duality
in prophecy has been recognized by
many scholars.
As
the
historical evidences
indicate,
the black Hebrews
were snatched from
the west coast of Africa and sold
into
captivity. Jeremiah again
says:
"For,
lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that
I
will bring
again the captivity of my people
Israel and Judah, saith

==================================================

=== CHUNK 248 ===
 the
Lord: and
I
will cause them
to return
to
the land
that
I
gave to their fathers, and they shall possess
it.
"For
it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of
hosts, that
I will break
his yoke from off thy neck, and will
burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more make him serve.
"But they
(the Hebrews) shall serve the Lord their God,
and David their king, whom
I will raise up unto them.
134
From Babylon to Timbuktu
"Therefore

()
Israel:
for,
lo,

thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity;
and Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest and tranquil, and
none shall make him afraid.
"For

==================================================

=== CHUNK 249 ===
t
Ezckiel represents the nations
that hold the black Hebrews
under slavery and oppression, and
the dry bones represent
the black Hebrews. F.zekiel says:
"So
I prophesied
as he commanded me, and
the breath
came into them, 83 and they
lived, and stood up upon
their
feet, an exceeding great army.
"Then he said unto me, son of man, these bones are the
whole house of Israel: behold, they say, our bones arc dried,
and our hope
is lost: we arc cut off.
"Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith
the
Lord God;
Ik-hold
I
will open your graves, 04 and cause you
to come up out of your graves85 and bring you into the land
of
Israel."
The prophet E/ckiel calls the country wherein the black
Hebrews are oppressed, "graves."
"And
ye
shall know
that
I am
the
Lord, when
I
have
opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out

At the time
that
I am writing these pages, Rev. Ralph
Abemathy
is traveling around the country telling the Ameri-
can people: "I am going to Washington to
tell the Pharaohs
to
let my people go." As
it was with the Pharaohs of ancient
Egypt, so
it
is unlikely
that the leaders in Washington
will
concede
to the demands of the Poor
People's March.
Considering
all
the
rampant
violence
in
the
United
States, there are many indications that the March on Wash-
ington
will erupt
into violence. The power
structure con-
cedes nothing without a demand. When the government
re-
fuses to effect reforms, and to implement justice, the people
lose respect for the institutions of "law and order"; law and
order without
justice are worthless
in a democracy. When
peaceful
demonstrations do not
soften
the
attitude
of
the
government, militant and vigorous
tactics must be employed
by the militants in order
to prevail upon
the government;
these tactics sometimes come close 

==================================================

=== CHUNK 251 ===
to anarchy. At
this tense
point, a mass movement can travel in one of two directions:
If the government concedes
to
the demands of
the people
"all well and good":
the mass movement
falls apart because
it has accomplished
its objective. On the other hand,
if the
government refuses the demands of the mass movement,
it
generally
suppresses
the
rebellion
or
civil
disobedience.
When the people continue to rebel and the government con-
tinues to suppress, this condition leads to fascism and a dic-
tatorship. There follows mass murder, which
is committed
in the name of law and order.
Dr. Martin Luther King expressed these thoughts before
he was
assassinated:
"If conditions do not change soon
in
136

this country, we will have a
fascist police state in the
1970s.
I don't think that America has the moral strength and will

to

take-

if rapid, collective, constructive action
is taken im-
mediately, we can save the

American
cities from
disaster.
If
a
police state
is established
in America,
this will
fulfill
the
prophecy of Daniel: 'And
at
that
time shall
Michael stand
up, the great prince which standeth
for the children of thy
people: and there shall be a time
of trouble, such
as never
was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at
that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall
be found written in the book." "

were

inhabitants of Arabia. The
scholars
are
doubtful of the path of march
of Zerah's army; but
I
believe that he
inarched from Arabia, not Egypt, because of the many Ethiopians living
in
Arabia. We must remember that Arabia was part of the Ethiopian
Empire and Josephus
calls
the Queen
of Sheba
the Queen
of Egypt

4. Obviously, the words Ophren and Apher are the same. In listing
the progeny of Abraham and Kcturah, the bible employs the word Apher
in Genesis
25:4. However, Josephus uses Ophren which
is
a
latinized
counterpart of the word Apher. We must remember that Josephus lived
and wrote in Rome. Now, the modern Latin spelling of Africa
is Afer.
For reference, see the word Afro in Webster's Dictionary. The word Afer
in
the Hebrew, Aramaic and Phoenician-Carthagian languages means
dust
or
earth, which
carries
a
connotation
of
blackness. The
early
Romans knew that the Libyans were black people. They most probably
knew,
a

lso,
that the word Afer meant darkness. Hence,
the nickname
for Africa
is
the "Dark Continent" which was given
to Africa by
the
Europeans.

6. The ancient Egyptians were a black-skinned
race. All available
evidence supports
this
fact. Any disposition or attempt
to
classify the
Egyptians as a Caucasoid race
is to be considered as a white supremacy
fallacy, depriving the black races of their heritage in order to glorify the
white race. Most statues and pictures of the ancient Egyptian gods and
kings
depict
black
qualities,
the
thick
lips
and
broad
noses.

B.C.,
the continent of Europe and
the
Middle East, as far as India, underwent a radical migratory transforma-
tion. The descent of the Indo Europeans or Indo Germans
is established
from
a common ancestor
(one
that
is
the descendant from Japheth)
probably
in
eastern
Europe. The
prehistoric
dialects
of
the
Indo-
Europeans accompanied
their migrations
into
the western
borders of
Europe,
Italy, Greece, Iran, Assyria
(now extinct)
,
Persia, and India.
When we
say
that an
individual
is Indo-European, we mean
Indo-Aryan. Many people from India arc Indo-Aryan. The prefix "Indo"
means Indian, and
the word "Aryan"
in
the
strict meaning stands for
tipper class or caste. In
the Aryan and Nari philosophy
the Aryan or
Germanic race
is supposed
to be the superior race or caste. Therefore,
when
the Aryans came
to India they established
their race
as the su-
perior one. As a
result, the caste system came into practice among the
black native Indians. The Aryan race

Flavius Josephus was a
member of the royal
priestly family in Jerusalem. He was at Jerusalem
when
the
city was destroyed by
the Romans. He was educated
in
the
politics of his nation and learned the religion and history of his people.
Josephus, obviously, had
the availability of the vital
historical
records
(other than the Bible)
which were contained
in the temple archives
in
Jerusalem.

Professor
A.
II. Godbey
writes
that
the
"Jewish Kingdom
of
Ghanata [or Ghana] was founded 300 a,a by "white Libyans" [Berbers]."
As much
as
I admire Godbey
for
his monumental
work, Lost
Tribes a Myth, Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
Press,
1930,
p. 256, see map, I must disagree with him when he says that the founders
of
the Jewish kingdom
of Ghanata were
"white
Libyans
[Berbers]."
Endeavoring
to
tell some
truths, and
at
the same time
trying not
to
render too much credit to the black
races, Godbey contradicts himself:

the Negro Sonrhai about 620

.
. Za came from Wargla in southern Algeria. At
this time
all Jews
in North
Africa were colored.
If you
trace or look
for Wargla on the map mentioned above, you will discover, in particular,
that the words "black Jew"
is written under the word Wargla
(remem-
ber. Za came from Wargla)
.
Godbey was professor of the Old Testament in Duke University,
Durham, North Carolina. He knew
the
entire
truth about
the
black
Jews, but he considered
it unwise
to reveal
everything. Godbey was
writing primarily
to
a white southern audience
in
1930. At
this time
the Ku Klux Klan was in
its heyday, and he did not want any reper-
cussions. Moreover,
if Godbey had said positively that
the Za Dynasty
and the original Jews were black,
the power structure and
the clergy
would have come down on him
like a storm.
Also, Heinrich Harth says that the kingdom of Ghana, or Ghanata
was founded by Wakayamagha

that Kayamagha was a

they are referring
to black people who have
thin

and thin lips. Caucasian features are found among many black Africans.

Rachel, a young Ethiopian Jew now living in Israel, displays a photograph of
her
fan,, y
left behind
in
Ethiopia. She discovered the photo among ones
brought to her school by visitors who had been to her hometown in Ethiopia
and had photographed members of the village. Rachel says she likes living in
Israel with her sister, but that she is sad much of the time due to the separation
from the rest of her family. Currently, some 16,000 Ethiopian Jews live in
Israel, but between 7,000 and 10,000 remain in Ethiopia, waiting to be rescued.
The book called Vie Valley of the Dry Bones
is a sequel to this book;
it
is about the conditions that face black people in America from the
biblical
view.
